class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis game is awesome. Yes, it takes quite a bit of inspiration from a certain series of games. Don't worry, it also has quite a few of it's own unique ideas.<br><br>The graphics are beautiful. The run down industrial aesthetic is well realized, the performance was great, and there are some really cool effects. The lighting, in particular, is awesome.<br><br>Story content is spread out in little bits and pieces here and there. There is some really great environmental storytelling as well. You will find audio-tapes, meet a few characters, watch video screens, etc. I wouldn't say it's the most compelling narrative in the entire world, but I think it works in the context of the game. It doesn't get in your face, but it's along for the ride. The voice work is pretty stellar IMHO. So, I would say it adds quite a bit of flavor and it's well worth the effort to engage with it.<br><br>The combat might take some getting used to if your a souls vet. If you give it time though, it is very crunchy and satisfying. By default, when you go for an execution, you get a really cool camera angle and it slows down and I can't put into words how awesome it looks and feels. It's got all the basics you expect, with some hidden depths: jumping, ducking, some unique combos, and if you hit the attack button at the right time you get reduced stamina usage.<br><br>You don't upgrade stats, you upgrade your suit. This gives you additional power (and slots) to install a variety of mods. One of my favorite builds was the &quot;Regen Tank of Doom&quot;. I would use a heavy-duty weapon, which was basically a big slab of metal. It, along with mods, ensured I was generating plenty of energy (sort of like mana that decays). I used an energy healing mod. I could smash enemies in the face with my big slab of metal, and if I took a hit or two, heal up right after.<br><br>There are a bunch of mods, and the fact that you can completely change your build at OPS (bonfire) means you are free to experiment.<br><br>There are a nice layout of weapons to suit different playstyles. The only issue is the lack of movesets. Each weapon type has one moveset, and all weapons of the type share it. The weapons and the movesets are fun enough, and it didn't hinder my enjoyment too much.<br><br>The armor system is particularly enjoyable. You don't find pieces in the world, you hack them off enemies to get a blueprint to craft them yourself. You get a head, two arms/legs, and a body. You can mix and match to your heart's desire, as each piece will have different bonuses. Or, go for the full set and get a set bonus, which are often really good. There is a good amount of variety here, and they look (and feel) really cool.<br><br>The different areas are well designed, and there is only one OPS in each major zone, with shortcuts opening up that snake back. It's really rewarding to work your way through an area, opening it up, and learning and conquering it's various hazards. There is a good amount of visual variety as well, and the areas are unique enough that you could call them out from a screenshot. There is one area that has one too many &quot;vents&quot; that look a bit samey, but the area is otherwise really unique and quite enjoyable.<br><br>Bosses. There is maybe one or two &quot;traditional&quot; boss fights. Most bosses are large robotic monstrosities, and most fights are fairly unique because of that. There aren't that many overall, but I like the direction they took. Each boss also has a unique weapon, and a &quot;powered up&quot; version that requires you to get creative.<br><br>The DLC has some of the coolest areas in the game, and a bunch of really cool weapons and armor. I would definitely recommend it. It's additional enemies, weapons, and areas really beef up the experience.<br><br> There are loads of options to play around with for graphics etc. You can even remap controller buttons, (which I did to make it more familiar to a certain game).<br><br>If you think you can handle the difficulty, get it. If you like the concept, get it. If you are willing to play a game that takes a page or two from the Souls book and then adds a couple of chapters of it's own, get it.\t\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNot actually sure why I am still trying to get enjoyment out of this game. Yet I am playing for second time on New Game +. (On last level now.) I think I just picked it up to see what it was like after I finished months ago. Then got into the habit.<br><br>My problem with it is that it's a love/hate relationship game. Right this minute I am hating it. I have been going back to the same place, most times recovering my scrap, but dying again and again. Just sick of setting off in the same direction, over and over again. Seen that area too many times now. (Lost my scrap too many times now, and therefore been bound to return.) All the obastacles to getting back there, like having to jump past flamethrower enemies in narrow corridors. (Alternatively, tackling flametrowers in corridors with gas, can result in instant death if they explode.)<br><br>It's just a nightmare of a game, too often. While being a good game often too. ... However in all sincerity, I could not recommend it to a friend and say, 'you must play'. I would even be cautious to say to a friend, 'well it's OK', even though it often is. Basically because, often it isn't. The only thing I could say is a summary of what I have said. It will really upset you quite a lot, but at times it's pretty good and almost a blast.<br><br>I really resent this premise that these games offer. You lose your scrap in The Surge, and in Dark Souls you lose your souls. Yet somehow you manage to keep all armour and weapons. It's just a cheap way of making a game hard. If you didn't lose your scrap/souls, if it was just fraction easier, and with a couple more levels. Then I would love it.<br><br>(Actually being an exception, this is how Dark Souls 3 was. I barely lost any souls over the whole game. Apart from the Iudex Gundyr fight, only minutes into DS3. I found that fight brutal.)<br><br>Instead these games artificially hype the difficulty, so they need to create less levels. Meaning simply less work for the developers. To be honest, The Surge does feel cheaply made because of this. (Additionally they implemented a massive re-use of levels too, making it feel even cheaper still.)\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Surge has some good ideas that are utterly ruined by the way they are presented. The Amusement Park DLC serves as a testament to how the game should have been, and to the fact the second game will likely be good. But it also serves to show just how bad the base game is. Here's the breakdown. <br>+: Interesting idea. A future where  in order for blue collar workers to stay relevant in the face of an increasingly robotic workforce driven by the whims of Sillicon Valley, they've had to meld themselves with the equipment they once operated, becoming stuff like were-frontloaders and were-hydraulic cutters. Is it cheesy? yes. Is it the perfect set up for a construction themed action game? Also yes. <br>+: Main character is alright in my book. <br>+: When the developers try, they can make extremely interesting and interlocking environments, on par with some of the areas from the souls areas. Special mention goes to the theme park DLC.  Sadly, this is only when they are trying. <br>+: That rootin, tootin music that plays in Ops rooms. <br>=: Some of the voice actors clearly phoned it in. This would be a negative if it was a story driven game.<br>-: Remember how fascinating the audio logs in bioshock games are? The audiologs in this game are nowhere near that level. It's two minutes of inane BS: &quot;oh wait this isn't a normal day at work I just spent two minutes explaining this is an ATTACK. This ATTACK is BAD&quot;. <br>-: Remember how I said the devs can make great levels when they try? They weren't for most of the game. In the base game you have such varied locales as: Outside Dusty Warehouse, Inside Dusty Warehouse, Dustier Warehouse, Very Big Warehouse, Dustier Warehouse With Some Plants. <br>-: You know how FROM will sometimes make &quot;player NPCs&quot; that share your movesets? I hope you liked facing off against the DS1 Forest Bandits,  DS2 Graverobbers, Yar'Ghul Hunter Pack, or the DS3 Black Hands because that's the only enemies in Surge for the most part; copies of the player with different weapons. Also drones, which are the most frustrating enemies imagineable. Sometimes you run into interesting stuff, or sad stuff (heres to the giant furnace bots that can only flail and rotate impotently as they try to burn you with their incredibly sloooooow flamethrower), but most of the time it's mirror match after mirror match interrupted by drones. <br>-:  Attack commiting makes the combat feel clunky and clumsy. The fast weapons feel equivalent to a medium speed weapon from souls, and it only goes downhill from their. Unlike Lords Of The Fallen where at least the slow weapons felt like trucks when they actually connected, here you will always be underwhelmed by the damage you deal. While this is an accurate portayal of a forklift fight between two bored warehouse workers, it doesn't make the game fun.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div

against the weakest enemy can get you killed in 2 or 3 hits, sometimes chained in a single, unblockable combo. It will take time to learn how to fight each enemy and to react quickly enough to not get killed. <br><br>There is a real progression curve in this game: after a while, you learn the patterns of enemies, how to doge and counter properly, and make the best of the implants! Definetly explore too, there are well hidden implants that are super useful! This game is really awesome!<br><br>Downsides: <br><br>- The default key layout are completely counter-intuitive, so I had to remap everything.<br>- The story isn't developped enough, there are question I would liked to have answered after finishing the game :/ <br>- An then, there is this FREAKING COUNTRY SONG in the safe rooms. I hate it so much. I wish I could shoot the radio airing it :( (fortunately, you can override that song though).\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAs a person who has a love-hate relationship with the Dark Souls games, I can safely recommend &quot;The Surge&quot; to anyone who's ever wanted to try a Dark Souls but actually wanted to understand what was going on! <br><br>In many ways, &quot;The Surge&quot; borrows HEAVILY from From Software's Dark Souls series. Many of the mechanics feel very close and many of the ideas are similar. Having you run around a world where everything is trying to kill you and almost everything *can*, from the lowest grunt to the mightiest boss, is right up the Dark Souls alley. You'll have to get good fast if you want to survive in this game. Also, mechanics like carrying souls for upgrades and losing them when you die if you can't collect them on your next life, (tech scrap in &quot;Surge&quot;), having a flask, (injections), armor with set bonuses, and bonfires, (OPS) make this world a challenging one.<br><br>What I liked though is that &quot;The Surge&quot; feels more like &quot;Intro to Sci-Fi Dark Souls&quot;. The game runs much more linearly than Dark Souls, making it a lot easier to learn an area, (even with all its twists and turns), and feeling like you've explored all the nooks and crannys before moving on. The gear progression is solid, the weapons all feel like they were crafted with love, and *blessedly*, the story is actually one you can understand!<br><br>They're not going to just hand everything to you, though. Just like in a Dark Souls game, you're going to need to use your brain and quick reflexes to remember where you are, where you're going, judge the risks vs. the rewards, and piece out the both the plot and where you need to go next. Unlike Dark Souls games, I only needed a guide a few times, since exploring around the area you are in will pretty much eventually give you an, &quot;aha!&quot; moment when you find that switch or hidden path you didn't see before that takes you where you need to go. Later levels get even more maze-like, but the same principle tends to hold true: explore the whole area, and you'll probably find your answer. <br><br>Overall, I really enjoyed this game... definitely more than Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2, although both are really good games. With &quot;the Surge&quot; I just felt that cheap deaths were less likely than in From Software's games. Your margin of error is a little wider, and the sci-fi backdrop is colorful, yet intense. <br><br>I give this a big thumbs up. It gave me a lot of the challenge without me wanting to completely kill myself like in a Dark Souls game, and the game design felt a little more linear, which gave me a much better experience. The world is much more fleshed out and real, and by the end, I was very satisifed with the experience, (though not the ending.) The ending, honestly, could have used a little more work. Still, it's a great game and a very solid intro to the Dark Souls style of gameplay for those looking to try it out in a slightly more forgiving enviornment.\t\t\t\t\t<div

Deck13 is the same studio that made Lords of the Fallen, and they've come a very long way since then.  They've learned that what makes a good soulslike is not just difficulty, but that it requires the player to understand it's mechanics.  Lords of the Fallen was just hard, with no depth, but The Surge can become a very easy game if you take the time to pay attention to how its mechanics really work.  It's this kind of nuance and attention to detail that make this game good.  The highest rated negative reviews, as of writing this review, seem to be from people that didn't look closely into how they could customize their character.  Dying too fast?  Upgrade your health or equip heavier armor.  Attacking too slow?  There's weapons with lighting fast attack speed.  Enemies attacking too fast?  Get a huge hammer and stunlock them to death.  Whatever problem you face, there's a solution.  You just have to think about it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\"

However I will say that map layouts are intricate and very confusing with seemingly endless amounts of shortcuts on shortcuts, and enemies lack variety so most of time it's the same song and dance. Other than that combat and controls feel pretty good and the world it builds is fairly interesting.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tA text guide on how to play The Surge<br>1. Watch videos online of other people playing, laugh at their misfortune.<br>2. Realize that you have experience with soulsborn games and decide '♥♥♥♥ it, I'll do better!'<br>3. Buy the game.<br>4. Realize that honestly the combat is slow and sluggish like always playing the Greatsword.<br>5a. If you were terrible with the greatsword, stick with the Staff or Twinrigged.<br>5b. If you were okay with the greatsword, try the one handed weapons.<br>5c. If you mained Greatsword, congrats, you can do all the weapons.<br>6. Realize a lot of enimies can be beaten by jumping back, then swinging in their general direction.<br>7. Do this 100x till you get armor/weapons, die twice as much till you can make a full suit and an alright weapon.<br>8. Get lulled into a false sense of security.<br>9. Fight Pax, the First Boss<br>10a. If you live on your first run you've either seen other people play and you're actually amazing for getting through one of the most possibly worst designed first boss for any game, seriously he's harder than some of the later bosses when he should be the easiest, congrats. Skip to 12.<br>10b. If you died, don't worry, it's actually one of the harder bosses of the game and for SOME REASON they made it the first.<br>11. Fight Pax 10x or at least till you figure out how to fight him.<br>12a. Realize most of your weapons are better than his normal drop thanks to not using single rigged.<br>12b. If you somehow killed him without hitting him with his own rockets, get his 'special' weapon which is marginally better. Skip to 14.<br>13. Sigh in defeat anyways.<br>14. Move on to the next area.<br>15. Get your own drone.<br>16. Realize it's pretty much useless except to cause minor damage or annoyance to mobs.<br>17. Realize that there's new armor and weapons.<br>18. Repeat steps 6-8.<br>19. Find out about Creo World.<br>20. Find out about even MORE new weapons and armor.<br>21. Repeat Step 18.<br>22. Fight the S&amp;R team leader, a CREO world boss.<br>22a. If you've beat him, congrats, you finished one branch of the guide.<br>22b. If you die, follow the next step.<br>23. Realize that he's literally the player with a staff.<br>24. Cry now that you realize even blocking is more of a suggesstion.<br>25. Watch as he does full damage even if you're blocking.<br>26. 81 damage.<br>27. Seriously Deck 13 what the ♥♥♥♥?<br>28. Why is this an early game boss?<br>29. I got further in Dark Souls 3 than I did in your game.<br>30. Go back to the main game.<br>31. Fight another boss that looks like an oversized bayblade.<br>32. This boss is pretty much 'spin to win' but you're the one getting spun on.<br>33. Take 25-30 dmg 4x in a spin.<br>34. Get hit for 82-90 when it slams a leg.<br>35. Realize your armor and weapons are pretty much the best they can be till you beat either boss.<br>36. get mad.<br>37. Remember Cave Johnson's Lemon rant.<br>38. Realize Cave Jonson didn't have to deal with an oversized Bayblade.<br>39a. If you beat the top, congrats, you finished the second branch of the guide.<br>39b. If you've given up, So did I.<br>40. Uninstall the game.<br>41. Look up stuff online.<br>42. Realize most bosses only got harder and more bs, except for Carbon Cat who's pretty much the first boss of DS3.<br>43. Play a less stressful game, like Darkest Dungeon.<br><br>That concludes the guide, here's hoping it helps!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Surge is my first proper souls-alike (not counting 2d entries such as Hollow Knight, which I loved, or Salt &amp; Sanctuary, which I bounced off of), and I think it's an entirely worthwhile game. <br><br>The mechanic of targeting specific limbs which might be armored or unarmored is a good one, particularly the touch of it being tied to receiving new equipment. The finishing moves look cool, but they kind of break the flow of combat. The map layouts are pretty good, replicating the feel of the original Dark Souls' trick of finding new shortcuts through the area as you progress. They do get a little overdesigned and tangled, making it hard to pick out landmarks. Boss variety is pretty good, although there's precious few of them; standard enemy design less so. It's pretty much all drones, big mechanical cats (basically), and a million guys in different armor.<br><br>I do feel like attacking in general is extremely clunky - I was using what I believed to me a medium-weight weapon (single rigged, in Surge terms), and I found the standard R1 attack (there aren't light or heavy attacks here, just horizontal and vertical slashes) nearly unusable. Once I learned that I basically had to dash attack in order to use the weapon properly, it was ok, but I think the nearly half-second delay between button press and contact is way too much. I tried lighter weapons but without impact enemies would usually just cut me apart while I attacked, without being able to stagger them, and they have much more health and do more damage than you do at pretty much all stages of the game.<br><br>Enemy damage is actually another particular problem - most enemies could take me out in just a couple of attacks, even with max upgraded armor and several health boosts equipped. There's virtually no recovering from a fight that goes bad - you're just dead if they manage to get more than one hit off on you, and running back to your corpse can be pretty frustrating if you can't get the hang of one particular enemy or boss.<br><br>The story was pretty good - I did like that it was significantly more explicit than the Souls series, and that I wasn't controlling a silent protagonist (which I actually have come to feel like are a bane on gaming these days). The characters were interesting and well-acted, and I was always curious about what would happen next.<br><br>In sum, pick this one up - I'm very interested in the upcoming sequel.\t\t\t\t\t<div

attack styles and there are plenty of weapons to gather and upgrade. <br><br>story also drives you forward, it's not anything mind blowing but it's average at least.<br><br>what don't i like?<br><br>if you want to get different armor and you don't have enough materials? back to grinding enemies that drop the right items. annoying as hell. also certain weapons seem to have &quot;special moves&quot; where you hit multiple times, wasting time and then you won't have time to dodge enemy attacks.<br><br>also sometimes you stagger an enemy but it still attacks when it's staggering. annoying as hell. <br><br>there is good enemy variety that brings new enemies when you get further in to the game.<br><br>if you like dark souls type of games, i would definetly recommend to check this out. pretty neat and i can't wait to get hands on Surge 2\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div

It's path driven, repetitive, and I wasn't able to defeat even the first boss after numerous upgrades and hours of grinding. The combat is unique, and somewhat interesting, and the setting and background story are interesting. <br><br>I will give it this - The use of the wheelchair in the beginning to keep you in the areas that you are restricted to is inspired. You can look at that huge staircase, and you sure aint going up it. Most games give you artificial reasons, or guards at the gate - this one gives you an understanding of what it must be like to be wheelchair bound. That gets full points for making me see something a new way, and why I didn't ask for a refund.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('43940335', 'recent' ); return false;\">Read More</a></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text review_was_helpful\">Was this review helpful?</span>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"vote_button_ctn\" id=\"reviewButtonContainer43940335\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( 0, 'https://store.steampowered.com/login/?redir=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2F%2Fapp%2F378540%23app_reviews_hash&redir_ssl=1&snr=1_5_100010__global-header', '43940335' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent43940335\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"></i> Yes</span></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( 0, 'https://store.steampowered.com/login/?redir=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2F%2Fapp%2F378540%23app_reviews_hash&redir_ssl=1&snr=1_5_100010__global-header', '43940335' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent43940335\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"></i> No</span></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( 0, 'https://store.steampowered.com/login/?redir=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2F%2Fapp%2F378540%23app_reviews_hash&redir_ssl=1&snr=1_5_100010__global-header', '43940335', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent43940335_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent43940335_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"></i> Funny</span></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReview_Award( 0, 'https://store.steampowered.com/login/?redir=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2F%2Fapp%2F378540%23app_reviews_hash&redir_ssl=1&snr=1_5_100010__global-header', '43940335', OnRecommendationAward )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin review_award_button\"><span><img src=\"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/public/shared/images//award_icon.svg\" class=\"reward_btn_icon\"> Award</span></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"vote_info\" >\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1 person found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>1 person found this review funny\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review_award_ctn\" id=\"reviewAwardContainer43940335\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"></div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div id=\"LoadMoreReviewsrecent\" class=\"load_more_reviews_btn\">\r\n\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0);\" onclick=\"LoadMoreReviews( 378540, 'AoJwj+mehOUCf57PpwE=', 0, -1, -1, 'recent' );\" class=\"btnv6_blue_blue_innerfade btn_medium\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<span>Load More Reviews</span>\r\n\t\t\t</a>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div id=\"LoadingMoreReviewsrecent\" style=\"display: none\" class=\"loading_more_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/public/shared/images/throbber.gif\" class=\"loading_more_reviews_throbber\">\r\n\t\t\tLoading reviews...\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n","dayrange":0,"start_date":-1,"end_date":-1,"recommendationids":["44607091","44603794","44600750","44577614","44532496","44460813","44453121","44418327","44417861","44382651","44379696","44377204","44354920","44339791","44274128","44230955","44229415","44147772","44094360","43940335"],"cursor":"AoJwj+mehOUCf57PpwE="}
