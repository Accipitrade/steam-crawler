The bulk of the gameplay, too, was genuinely good. The exploration was satisfying, the resource management felt good, and the build variety was enough to make me feel like I was doing my own thing. <br><br>The bosses, however, were awful. Which, for this genre, is a deal-breaker. The whole &quot;target their limbs&quot; stuff worked great, but someone responsible for balancing the game decided to make all bosses deal insane amounts of damage, even if you opt to go for the slow but supposedly sturdy armor. Add on the fact that there were very few actual bosses (maybe 5, if I'm remembering correctly), and it made for a disappointing rather than satisfying feeling every time I encountered and defeated one. <br><br>Combat could have been better, but I understand that it may have just been my playstyle (single-rigged weapons) that felt slow and clunky. I did very little experimentation beyond heavy weapons, as that's my preferred weapon type. I never got to max level and likely never will return to see what's behind the literally level-gated content. <br><br>Overall, it was worth the price I paid, but it wasn't worth the frustration I put into it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('55466477',

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI may have never seen an idea that ruins itself so much by trying to be something it is not quite so much as The Surge.<br><br>To be honest, when the game begins, the combat is fun. While it balances the difficulty high, it is still fair, and the challenge is reasonable and it makes the game very enjoyable. However, this all goes away during the first boss fight, and the ramping absurd difficulty issues lasted until I gave up with this game. This, paired with the very repetitive nature of the combat makes for a game that will get boring fast.<br><br>It really is not all that fun, partially because of how it feels, to be honest. While people who love The Surge hate the comparison to Dark Souls, it is very fair and important to compare them. For instance, compare with Dark Souls. That game is basically 3D Castlevania with RPG mechanics and multiplayer functionality. However, it keeps the basic clunkiness and slowness of oldschool Castlevania as well as stuff such as Ghouls and Ghosts. The difficulty in Dark Souls is actually very overblown. However, the mechanics fit with its predecessors, and blend with subject material from Dungeons and Dragons to make the game.<br>However, The Surge is not a Fantasy game, but instead a Science Fiction game. This is significant, as the mechanics in Dark Souls work only as fantasy, so they do not translate well in a world without magic. To make matters worse, it makes the mechanics grate on you. I thought to myself &quot;I found the same weapon as before, only this one is on fire&quot;. In any other game, this would sound incredible, but The Surge makes this subject absolutely underwhelming. The reason is that the mechanics are just so bland in their process, and lack any real variety. <br><br>However, it even gets worse when you take into consideration the value of engineering in the game lore. I would think to myself &quot;This is a high tech place, where are some neat guns?&quot; and other questions. The first boss has a missile launcher system, so you might think you would see some interesting ranged weapons, but I have yet to see anything of note. Your player character is a hire for the company in the game, which is a tech company pioneering the latst stuff, so perhaps you imagine your character engineering a grappling hook you can use to attack flying drones and fling around the city, developing a flamethrower out of scrap tech and fuel, or maybe you imagine acquiring rocket boots that allow you to jump super high? Your love of this fades when you realize that there is nothing that cool in the game. This game tries so hard to be Dark Souls that it ruins any chance it has at creating its own unique flavor. For this reason, I suggest not purchasing it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\"

to finish the game after spending several hours on it.<br><br>One of the strongest points of this game for me is the story. You definitely should follow each character storyline from the very beginning, search for every video or audiolog as it is crucial to find them all. Believe me, you won't regret.<br><br>The level design of the Surge is controversial but well-thought. All these shortcuts, how you locate them along with the game progression. If you look at all locations together it is amazing what complex, huge piece of work was done here. But in order to appreciate it, you should be ready to memorize the map, know where the danger is hidden. I must admit that some locations do not look colourful or picturesque but come on, it is a factory, what did you expect? Plus, if you crave for some diversity, there is a great DLC that can get you on a train to the Creo World. Choo-choo! Or just play enough to reach the Executive level that will definitely please your thirst for beauty.<br><br>It is also nice to see how the studio Deck13 has grown over the years. I remember the time when their RPG game Venetica appeared in my hands in 2009. If you are interested in their work, I highly recommend you to try it as well. <br><br><a class=\"bb_link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/338140/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"\"

It was a hell of a learning curve but now that ive got it this game is INCREDIBLY FUN. <br><br>The only bad thing i can say about it is things are NOT very well explained in this game. Like elemental damage and things like that. (I still have no Idea what the elemental damage does)<br><br>Where you are supposed to be going, and dont even get me started on the &quot;hardcore kill&quot; system. The Wikipedia for this game is also qutie garbage. If it where not for youtube I'd have missed quite a lot of content, weapons, ETC. I still check youtube before any boss so i know how to get the high end drops...this kind of stuff should REALLY be hinted at in game. (the first boss for example drops pretty much the best heavy weapon in game that will carry you througout the content, but only if you kill it in a very specific way) <br><br>I also got the odd crash to desktop. but other than that would reccomend. If you buy. I highly suggest you thumb aroud youtube for basic stuff and how to deal with bosses or the first one will make you want to quit life.

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAn almost exclusively melee-focused sci-fi Dark Souls-alike with a fairly wide variety of weapons and armor options, some of which were added with free DLC. You can mix and match different armor pieces, which is nice. Weapons come in various types, some fairly unusual. The dismemberment game mechanic works fairly well, fits well enough into the somewhat slow and clumsy, timing-based combat. Note also that dismembering humanoid enemies is non-optional; you need to, or you won't have access to new weapons and upgrades. The violence level is pretty high, and some dark stuff is going on in the lore and audio logs, so be warned; this game isn't exactly what you'd call family-friendly by usual standards.<br><br>There's fun to be had, and the story is somewhat interesting, as is the setting. I did find myself wanting to play it through to the end sooner or later, but at the same time, the large, excessively sprawling levels can be a hindrance to enthusiasm and enjoyment. To elaborate, you all too often find yourself going down the exact same type of maintenance tunnel, up and down the exact same types of mini-lifts, and when you're exploring a huge multi-story chamber chock full of pipes and gantries and stairs and platforms and eleventeen million obstructions... it doesn't help at all that every single tunnel and every single mini-lift looks identical to all the others. You'll need a sharp spatial awareness and/or perfect memory to avoid stomping about in circles, absent-mindedly bashing the respawned-upon-rest enemies out of the way as you try to figure out where the crap the conduit from the last important-looking console you poked, leads to.<br><br>As for the overall game design, sometimes the game has you go up and down and all around a given area before it deigns to allow progress to occur, and while this makes sense on some levels, it can be an impediment to pace and enjoyment. It's almost like some sort of scavenger hunt puzzle game with cyborg violence added almost as an afterthought. Which is a shame, because when it flows well, it's fun to play.<br><br>It just kind of doesn't flow well all that often. I hear the sequel's pretty good, so maybe just skip to that if you're in doubt. Or wait for a sale. Mildly recommended, not a terrible or even bad game overall, but unfortunately rather flawed.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSometimes I go back, and play games that really spoke to me. That I enjoyed, and made me grow as a person. This is, perhaps, not one of those.<br><br>\\<br><br>This game reeks of DarkSouls-clone. Which, on it's own, is not a bad thing. In fact, there have been some games that pull this off, really make it both unique and familiar, and create their own established name for themselves.<br><br>This.. uh.. Let's say that they are missing some of the key-elements.<br><br>Those being, first and foremost, the controls. The controls are nothing like a Souls-esque game. To be completely blunt; they are wildly inaccurate, totally unreliable, and frankly, very laggy. Essentially; whatever 'improvement' was meant for this games controls, because it seems fairly obvious it was meant to be, was very lost upon execution.<br><br>The game runs, for a mid-range PC, at an incredible work-load. It's unreasonable, the strain that it puts on any given PC (except you, of course, the behemoths that have PCs strong enough to compute all of NASAs missions from the last 50 years), and the controls suffer from it.<br><br>Not to say that they are good on their own, PC capability not-withstanding: Everything is delayed, taking time out of actual-reaction to perform. While, yes, this is something DarkSouls had in their kit of make-stuff-harder-because-we-hate-players, in the first installment, it was never very impactful once it was a learned skill. You learned, after many many deaths, how to time your movements, based on a slight (and reliable) delay in execution.<br><br>This game.. Oh god.. It's about as reliable as a classroom kindergarten eye exam. It lies about what it sees; a lot. There is no real fix for the input time, as the input is directly linked to a built-in delay. Effectively meaning that, no matter how absolutely stunning (or Play-Dough castle-ish) the background is... your dodge/attack/heal has a built-in delay, plus whatever computation time your computer required at that moment. Which makes it vary. A lot. A ridiculous amount, given that the game expects visual/audio flashing queues for response time... Those, are likely not measured in seconds.<br><br> Effectively, instead of a delay that is reliable, learnable, and executable; you find yourself with a dodge/attack/heal ability that varies so much, it's worth running back to a safe-zone until you know how to defeat the next enemy: by watching their moves after you've left, internet probably included. Or, you die. A lot. Not a DarkSouls a lot.. More than that. Because without preemptive knowledge, you cannot predict the next major encounter. While also battling a button press vs the absolute character movement.<br><br>Nice, yeah.. good luck. Y'GD noob.<br><br>OK, let's talk gameplay, instead of trying to ego-trip someone with NASA hardware.. Saying, as if it were something that is common-place, that you had a PC that could keep up with this game without framerate drope; you would find yourself in one of three places:<br>1q) This story is ok, the combat is ok, and the loot is ok.. What do I do? <br>          1a) You revel in the amount of money you spent on this, just to have a mediocre game, in which the story is unimportant, and the goal was to make a DS clone. Play it, finish it.. Move on. Quickly, perhaps.<br>2q) I love the story, but the combat and upgrade/loot system is stopping me from going forward.. how do I fix it?<br>          2a) You grind. You do this, essentially until your level matches the linear progression. Yes, it'll take 3 hours just to get there; entering and re-entering zones, but then again, that was the point. I recommend writing down the story elements so you don't forget.<br>3q) The combat is fun and challenging, but I don't care about the story. Do I get a good ending to this, at least?<br>          3a) No.<br><br>Buy this game, and ONLY buy this game, if you are both a NASA-certified PC user, and a masochist. My advice, as far as it'll get me, is to go play DarkSouls again. Try a wildly impossible character variant. Duck-Tape your arms together. Put gum around your joy-sticks.<br><br>Maybe try a milkshake, they are known for happiness-provision. Good luck, I suppose.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\"

and not as good. Whatever. I never got into Dark Souls because of the setting and this proved the perfect gateway for me into this kind of style of game. Make no mistake, this game is challenging, but I felt like it was a rewarding kind. It's the type of game where you'll sink in hours at a time because you misjudged a certain enemy and then try to reclaim you dignity (and items) by going back to that point with a new tactic or set of weapons and armor. I'll agree with a few other people who've said this isn't a game you play for story, but that you play to just have some fun. It is very rewarding breezing through enemies that you had a tough time with in the beginning due to your built upon experience and higher grade equipment.\t\t\t\t\t<div

But once you master the combat it’s very rewarding. The limb severing system to acquire armour sets is very compelling, the locations are very darkly atmospheric, and overall it’s amazing fun. As with most games like this, it picks up bad reviews from people who find it too hard - but it’s a brilliant game.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis Game Is Actually Quite Facinating:<br><br>       To all those who have seen the game and played it for the free weekend, this game can get to you if you give it time. I played the Dark Soul games and never beat them due to rage. The Dark Souls games are difficult, and yes The Surge seems a bit more forgiving but, you need to give it a better chance on it. The Surge is a Sci-Fi type of game, yes, and the person seems a bit slow at first, well duh cuz at the beginning of the game you see that he can't even walk. Warren is a man in a wheelchair that is applying for a job to CREO where they make exo-suits for people like him can work and for people to &quot;Evolve&quot; into a better society. The Surge also has some unique aspect to it there are things i do bicker up the option of things in this game that could of been added. There are a lot of comments that put this down cuz of the clunky knees of the controls, some are about how it is like Bloodborn or like the Dark Souls games but more crashy. There is things I shall discuss due to Strategies, Things that could of been added before the game was published and sent to the public or updated before the coming of The Surge 2, The Forgiveness to it compared to the Dark Souls Games and Bloodborn, and The aspects of the armor classes, as well as the weapon classes.<br><br>The Controls Are Not Clunky:<br><br>       I use a afterglow ps3 controller when i play this game and i thought at first that it was going to be a hard game due to the controls, but instead it was a different experience due to the slowness of the attacks (compared to the types of weapons you use). If you think about it, yeh it may seem clunky, but the guy for one has never walked before in years or maybe all of his life so he is going to be a bit slow on his movements. On top of that, he has the exo-suit physically attached to him and that is pure metal that is being attached to his bones and flesh so it will weigh on him a bit. Yet I digress that the exo-suit is attached to every part of his body so it can some-what level out the weight all together, but he is not used to it at first and by the time he does get used to it, the armor he has on also weighs differently to his body as well. So he may attack slowly, but the game evens it out that he is not the only one slow on his attacks at first cuz the zombies that he attacks are slow on their attacks and movements as well. So the controls should not seem so clunky.<br><br>The Little Thing I Will Bicker About The Things That Could Of Been Added Before The Game Release Of Either Of The 2 Games:<br><br>      There are a little of things I will bicker about this game. Now I for one love game music and I feel like there should of been a type of music when in each area, or at least have different music in the chamber you go and take care of your scrap. Honestly that is all I have to Bicker on is the music aspect to add suspense or add just soothing areas when it is needed. Boss Battle Music is also a must. The game just needs that and then it is truly Monifice'.<br><br>The Way It Is More Crashy Than Dark Souls Or Bloodborn:<br><br>       The game is not crashy, you are just not patient on the game. The game needs its time to load in the last peices and then it shows up. I have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC and I have never had a single game or PC crash at all from this game. You guys are just impatient for games to load and that is why you guys think it is crashy. Give it time for the game is good with patience, not impatience.<br><br>Strategies That Are Good To Have In The Game:<br><br>     There are a good amount of strategies in this game; Bunny Hoping, Swift Jumping, and Fast Blocking are the best. <br>               Bunny Hopping:<br>                     Bunny hopping is where you use a lot of your stamina to dodge back and forth as you attack when going forwards. If <br>                     you get 'The Good, The Bad, And The Augmented' DLC, then you willl have a good time in the game, if you are free <br>                     playing it, then here is what I suggest.<br>                                Those who are free playing it<br>                                       You want to start off with the Rhino gear and farm the Lynx armor from the first zombies that you meet. If <br>                                       you want to collect all the armor classes in the game, then you start off with the Rhino no matter what. <br>                                       When you get the Lynx armor, you are set in stone for the starting of Bunny Hopping. <br>                              (Dodge Forward+Light Attack, Dodge Back, Dodge Forward+Light Attack - Repeat)<br>                                Those who have all the DLC's and the full game<br>                                       You still start with the Rhino gear and farm the Lynx Armor From the first zombies that you meet. Don't <br>                                       open the first door till you have all the augments (the agression modulator and such) and have all the <br>                                       armor (two Rhino Legs + two Rhino arms + Lynx chest armor + Lynx Head) because with that, you will be <br>                                       able to access the DLC with a bit better luck. Use the Bunny Hoping for your attacks if you want to. You <br>                                       have enough defense to last you to the area you need to go to get the power turned on. Do not open the <br>                                       door where the guy is stuck in a room until you meet the DLC room. You hear it when you backtrack after <br>                                       the power is turned back on. The DLC 'The Good, The Bad, The Augmented' has a special piece you <br>                                       need that can let you take less stamina to dodge. Then you are truly almost set in stone for the ultimate <br>                                       Bunny Hopping till you get the MG Gorgon armor set. It is the tankiest and best armor in the game for <br>                                       Bunny Hopping because of the special perk the full MG Gorgon set gives you. Your stamina almost as  <br>                                       fast as you use it will return back to full. So that means that you can Bunny Hop like an Italian <br>                                       ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when its time for Spagetti! You will be set in stone.<br>              Swift Jumping<br>                   Swift Jumping is a lot like Bunny Hoping in a sense, but not entirely. Swift Jumping is when you need to just dodge to <br>                   the side to the enemy really quickly to 'back-stab them' in a sense. You just follow the same thing as Bunny Hopping <br>                   on what you need to do this process. Here is the move set though:<br>                       (Dodge Right or Left + Light Attack - Repeat) <br>                   It may sound like a slow way to circle a person while attacking. but it is effective.<br>              Fast Blocking<br>                   Fast Blocking is only really effective when you have a heavy duty weapon attached and equipped to Warren. You can <br>                   quickly time the attacks of you enemies if you watch how they attack in a certain pattern if they have melee weapons. <br>                   They all have a specific pattern that they follow due to the coding the devs gave them. Nothing is different in attacks <br>                   depending on each weapon equipped by the zombies or security zombies as well as cyborgs/synths. If you block with <br>                   the heavy weapon fast enough, you can get a small window to switch to a light melee weapon (aka one handed, staff, <br>                   twin rigged) and do some damage to them. That is the Fast Block Advantage Point. If you do that, then you are set in <br>                   stone for a lot of enemies. Bosses, NO! Regular Evil Peeps, YES!<br><br>Steam stopped me for putting more so more is coming in a moment.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLots of people are trying this game in preparation of The Surge 2, and you'll typically find them giving negative and grating reviews of the difficulty being too much, or the areas looking similar. These are the same people who got on the Dark Souls bandwagon when Dark Souls II came out, then went to Dark Souls thinking it'd be as easy as the second game. <br><br>The combat is fun, high stakes, and when you hit an enemy it feels like you've hit them hard. I guess that's partly because the game focuses on a character literally wearing construction equipment. From heavy lifting forklift arms, to welding guns, and everything in between. The style of combat really reflects the weapons at your disposal.<br><br>I don't want to compare it to Dark Souls, since it'd be similar to comparing a screwdriver to a drill. Everyone wants a screw driver, but then they come over to the hand drill section and say that the drill is bad, because it's not exactly like the screwdriver. <br><br>The game has similar mechanics to the Souls genre, but such can be said about many, many, many, third person hack and slash games. If you've got a reusable healing item and a third person camera, people call you a souls-like. And I'm going off topic. <br><br>If you want combat that feels like a random guy in a wheel chair just jumped into a forklift and started fighting a team of cops in an armored car, this is what you'll want. <br><br>Play Surge because you want a game about exo suits and fighting robots. Don't come here because it has souls-like as a tag. You won't like what you get.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\"

You need to avoid the slow weapons if you want to have fun in the game.  The developers did a really poor job of balancing them with the enemy types.  This lack of balance also allows the game to basically be exploited by spamming slide attacks and your drones.  the enemies have no answer for this.  Lets see if they fix this in the surge 2.  Disregard my hours played metric, ive played through this game multiple times on console and grabbed the PC port when on sale.  Once you get into the groove this game is rewarding.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\"

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you came to this game because you enjoyed Dark Souls, don't get your hopes up. The Surge is basically Forklift Fighting Simulator, and you're also one of the forklifts. Yes it plays somewhat similar to DS, but it is nowhere near as refined or as in depth in terms of combat mechanics and fluidity. Even after getting used to the combat system it just feels clunky and slow. You get caught into strings of combo moves that you didn't hit the attack button for and hitting the dodge button only seems to make him attack more. The enemies telegraph heavily but you have to rely more on blocking than dodging their attacks if you string combos, and just putting up your guard costs stamina even if you don't take a hit. Your dodge distance is pretty large, but enemy attacks aren't pixel perfect and you'll get clipped a lot unless you dodge directly away instead of to the sides. Leveling up doesn't actually improve your stats, it just lets you bolt on more parts and implants. You'll also find lots of implants that are basically useless treasure fodder. I've really been trying to get into this game, but it just feels too off.<br><br>The story is meh and the game play is meh. The only way I can honestly recommend The Surge is if you get it on sale dirt cheap like I did. It's just another game to pass the time and nothing spectacular in my book.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tthis is a good soulslike game that will keep you entertained for many hours although i must add that combat is a little different than dks. in dks, you attack enemy when they are recovering from an attack. in this one there is almost no recovery, but there is a 1-2seconds of cooldown period where enemy will not do anything offensive so you can hit them. also using iframes, compared to dks, is not very rewarding. instead, dashing away seems to be the real tactic youre gonna use most of the time. i had to use iframes only for the final boss in the game, other than that it is not necessary and must be used with caution as they are very very short. difficulty is similar to dks, if you were able to dks games solo you won't have much trouble with this one, especially healing is too easy in this game, you don't have to go through any animations so waiting for a safe moment to use estus is not necessary, you can just press the button and instantly heal any time. there are a lot of weapons which increases the games replay value <br><br>only bad thing about this game is level design. it is maze-like and i had to draw a map to be able to find my way around. in souls games levels arent confusing because you can easily memorize levels thanks to how different everything is. in this one every area looks samey so you must either draw a map or consult to a very good memory. if you dont you will easily lose yourself.<br><br>and don't be confused with idiots who say that combat is clunky. seriously go read any dks game reviews or salt and sanctuary reviews or any other souls-like game reviews there are always some idiots that will say how clunky combat is simply because they don't understand / they don't spend time understanding the nature of combat in this kind of games. i have played tons of soulslike games and i dont remember any of them being clunky\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI decided to get this game because The Surge 2 is coming. I'm a big fan of Souls games. I knew this wouldn't be as good as any of the Souls, but I would be happy with something mediocre. This is not. This is bad.<br><br>The developers clearly love the Souls games, this being their second soulslike, and both are the most similar to Souls games among all soulslike. But I don't think they understand it fully, or had the time to do really do what they wanted. Anything that they decided to change got worse. What they didn't change, well, is bad anyway.<br><br>The main example (aside from the notoriously atrocious first boss - and third boss... any boss really) are the common enemies: The developers understand that attacks that deal a lot of damage have to be well telegraphed. Ok, they managed to almost do it, but they do well enough... except that the most damaging move of 90% of enemies are the ones that have 0 anticipation animation. It's so absolutely baffling that something so absurd is in the game... I mean, this game was play-tested. If they can't fix it for some reason, removing it would be the clear option.<br><br>There is another baffling design choice. There is a place, some hours in, that teaches you a different kind of dodge: ducking and jumping (and countering after dodging). The game sends a enemy to teach you this, this enemy has a attack that hits high and another that hits low. Great design isn't it? Except that if you try it, you'll notice that doing this means you'll hit the front of this enemy, which has an armor that absorbs most of your damage, and it makes it infinitely harder and takes ten times longer than just going around and hitting in the back. I don't know what to say really.<br><br>Of course, there are many other things that are bad, like the maze-like map, inspired by souls games, but that any place looks similar to any other... the different kinds of enemy attacks that have no &quot;tell&quot; animation, the badly design damage of enemies, the fact that some of your normal attacks sometimes lock you into a 3 sec animation.  The lack of feel on any hit you get on enemies or vice-versa.<br><br>I really recommend Ingenious Clown's review of this game on youtube. Sums up my experience. In the end, I played many hours of this game, but I can assure you that, even buying on a sale, it wasn't worth it. I continued playing it expecting something to click, but it never did.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div
