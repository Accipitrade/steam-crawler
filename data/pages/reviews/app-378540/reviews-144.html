class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t**scroll to bottom for TLDR review**<br><br>... I woke up in my usual spot on the floor of the OPS center, huddled near the Medbay.  The gentle hum of electronic equipment always helped me fall asleep after a hard day of exo-salvaging.  No, I'm not that work-aholic who sleeps in the office.  Circumstances had been less than ordinary for the past... I don't know, days?  Weeks?  Suffice to say, things have been happening.  <br><br>Before passing out from exhaustion the previous night, I had made a few interesting discoveries while exploring the factory.   I decided to buzz Sally on the communication terminal to see if she had any interesting observations. She gave me her usual carping about distress beacons, and I continued to wonder if she might be an AI of some kind.  All joking aside, the slight pang of attraction I had felt upon first meeting her made me feel uneasy - could someone be manipulating me?  I always had a hard time saying &quot;no&quot; to women. <br><br>... I also had a streak of paranoia that could be described as... &quot;not insignificant.&quot;  At any rate, I felt hopelessly ignorant of my situation here, and she was the only person that had helped me move forward at all.  What &quot;forward&quot; meant, exactly, remained to be seen.  I couldn't even remember the details of why I currently &quot;enjoyed&quot; the use of a military-grade exoskeleton.  I remembered accepting a manufacturing position at CREO (they were quite literally the only company hiring these days), and going through an orientation process, after which I woke up amid flaming wreckage somehwere inside the compound.   <br><br>Like I said, things have been happening.  Nevertheless, I gave the weird guy, Warren a &quot;please-don't-stop-me-right-now&quot; nod, walked past Davey without acknowledgement (sometimes I regretted rescuing that worm), and &quot;forward&quot; I went, into the factory.  <br><br>&quot;Look out for your fellow workers.  They look out for you,&quot; the creepy female computer voice droned as I walked out the door.  Sensible words for a manufacturing environment, but lately they had taken on a new meaning.<br><br>I decided the logical thing to do would be to pick up where I had left off.  I had recently found the entrance to Toxic Waste Disposal and had been... reclaiming some equipment.  I made my way back down there, giving co-workers the usual high fives and fist bumps along the way.  <br><br>Finally I made it to Toxic Waste.  I saw a new co-worker, equipped with a few pieces of Liquidator anti-exposure gear, which I had been collecting.  I jogged up behind him, did a mechanically-assisted baseball slide, and simultaneously brought my katana-length Vibro-Sawzall down in a sideways hacking motion, directed at the back of his knees.  Not how I would usually introduce myself to a co-worker.  Again, things have been happening.  <br><br>The guy seemed barely conscious like the rest of them.  Almost feral even.  He grunted, stumbled to a knee from the impact, and I raised my weapon for the coup de grace.  <br><br>&quot;THWONG!!!&quot;  The impact caught me beneath the jaw, only partially absorbed by my Sentinal class headgear.  The scab had taken advantage of my over-confidence and landed an uppercut with several hundred pounds of force behind it.  That was unexpected, which only made it hurt more.  This guy might wander around like a drunken zombie, but his exosuit was still capable of viscious speed.  Never let your guard down in exo-combat.<br><br>I shook it off just in time to raise my left arm and deflect the next attack, causing him to recoil back on his heels a bit.  Or, technically speaking, destabilizing the gyros of his suit just enough to make it take a step backwards.  But I wasn't going to allow that.  While my left hand was still following through from the deflection, I swept the Sawzall in my right hand down with an arc, aiming once again for the knees, as if harvesting wheat.  His Operator class stilts did little this time to protect the fleshy bits from the force my suit was applying.  There was a sickening metallic/organic crunch as the Liquidator leg gear (free leg included!) tore free and came to rest on the floor about a foot away from... the rest of the equipment.  <br><br>&quot;Sorry, I guess.&quot;  I shrugged and picked up the gear, excited to have completed the set.    <br><br>It was all over in a few seconds.  I didn't have confirmation, but I was beginning to wonder if the neural implants driving my exosuit came along with some sort of &quot;frame-jacking&quot; ability that allowed me to experience time at a much faster subjective rate.  It was a strange sensation that I couldn't fully describe if pressed.  It just seemed like I was a bit more... precise than before.  Especially when my adrenaline was pumping and my fight or flight instinct was engaged.  <br><br>Wow, not to mention, my mind seemed to be constantly wandering and multi-tasking, like a computer with ADD.  I continued through Toxic Waste and found a Power Terminal, with the number &quot;10&quot; brightly contrasted in red and green on an LED screen.  I used the power core of my suit to bypass the terminal's PSU, overloading the terminal.  The terminal sparked like ball-lightning and a large set of steel doors nearby slid open, disappearing into the walls.  <br><br>Upon closer inspection, I realized the doors led to an elevator.  With anticipation, I stepped on and waited for the pressure-sensitive subfloor to register my weight, engaging the magnetic drive.  <br><br>&quot;Ha, love it when that happens,&quot; I said as the elevator doors opened and I found myself back at the main level, just around the corner from OPS.  I ran into OPS to craft my newly acquired Liquidator gear and try on the completed set.  Along with protecting against exposure to toxic radiation, fire, electricity, etc., the Liquidator set reduced stamina cost from dodging, and was by far the coolest looking I had seen yet.  The drawback was it had less armor, and wasn't as stable against heavy impacts.  Hey, &quot;you look good, you play good,&quot; right?  I decided to keep it, uh, installed.  <br><br>Vital injections refilled, sweet looking new suit with a sick green light, I set off once again.  This time, taking the new elevator shortcut back down to Toxic Waste.  I had seen the words &quot;Hazardous Bla Bla&quot; stenciled on a wall and wanted to use my new hazmat exosuit for some exploring.  <br><br>&quot;HAZARDOUS WASTE STORAGE&quot;  I noticed the marking again as I made my way down the corridor.  I couldn't help but notice there appeared to be a major problem &quot;storing&quot; the &quot;hazardous waste,&quot; because there was toxic material literally all over the place.  I was glad to be wearing the full set of Liquidator gear because it was hard to step anywhere without at least some exposure.  It even looked like it might have been growing.  <br><br>&quot;Things have definitely been happening,&quot; I mused as I walked through a large holographic door into a room large enough to be used as an aircraft hangar.  <br><br>A loud computerized female voice said &quot;CONTAMINATION DETECTED.  LOCKDOWN IN OPERATION.  INITIATING DISPOSAL MEASURES.&quot;  The holographic door behind me turned red.  <br><br>Upon entering, I hadn't noticed the truck-sized, round, multi-legged robot hovering in a dimly lit corner, which was now approaching me menacingly.  There was a problem with hazardous waste indeed, and apparently the problem was ME.     <br><br>&quot;PLEASE REMAIN STATIONARY DURING CLEANUP PROCEDURE.&quot;  <br><br>Don't think I'll be doing that, thanks. Come get some, you spindly son-of-a- <br><br>&quot;THWONG!&quot;<br><br>-- I woke up in my usual spot on the floor of the OPS center, huddled near the Medbay...<br><br><br>*Had no idea how long my attempt at fanfic would end up or if it would fit.  But I'll try to squeeze on a review.<br><br>++Sci-Fi Dark Souls - Pulled it off.  Intriguing setting, looks good, plays good.  <br>+Time limit to retrieve Scrap-  Interesting mechanic, especially combined w/ next:    <br>++Limb-targeting- Situational (think Dead Space), adds combat depth.  You won't always go for the head or the unarmored limb.<br>--Could be more variety with weapons, abilities, suits, perks.  Tech analogs for magic abilities would be great.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\"

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI was tempted to review this after a few hours of playing as I really struggled to get into it. I decided to go back and finish the game and I am glad I did<br><br>The Surge is a game based around the Soulslike premise as seen in Dark Souls, Demon Souls and Bloodborne. The game has resources, tech scraps which you use to level up and upgrade gear that you drop on death, but that can be collected from the place you died on respawning.<br><br>I'll break down my review into several categories<br><br>COMBAT:<br>The combat in The Surge is a lot smoother than in Dark Souls, it focusses more around dodging than blocking, a skill I barely used in the game, but still retains that heaviness that Soulslike games tend to have. <br><br>You lock on to enemies to focus your attacks on, but you can select what parts to attack. This is used so you can see what parts are armoured or unarmoured so you can kill them faster or try to loot their gear. The enemy variety is a bit limited, but I didn't find myself getting bored of it. The enemies are fairly strong, but they broadcast most of their attacks so it doesn't feel too unfair when you die. As the game progresses the enemies change their equipment and attack patterns, so you need to adjust how you fight them accordingly.<br><br>ENEMIES:<br>Enemy variety is a bit limited, its humans with different armour and weapons mostly with a few robots and other weirder things a bit later on. The different types behave fairly similar so you can notice patterns consistently and fight around it. <br><br>PROGRESSION:<br>Progression is done by levelling up your Power Core with Tech Scrap. You get Tech Scrap from killing enemies as well as item drops. The higher your Power Core, the more power you have to play with. You use power to equip weapons, armour and implants. Weapons and armour are fairly self explanitory but the implants is as close to character customisation as this game comes. You can only change your equipment in a safe room called the OPS Centre, but you can swap them out as and when you want inside there, essentially respeccing your character as many times as you want. The OPS Centre works like the Bonfire at Dark Souls, using the Med Bay to heal yourself and restore your injectables resets all of the enemies in the current area. One thing I did like is the ability to bank scrap at the OPS Centre for later use. This mitigates one issue I had with Dark Souls where I had a lot of souls, but not enough to level up which ended up with me losing more than I needed. Thankfully this game gets around this.<br><br>Different types of armour are aquired by cutting them off enemies and rebuilding them. This is really satisfying as you hack bits off enemies and rebuild them for yourself. The weapons are either dropped by enemies or found around the map.<br><br><br>BOSSES:<br>The bosses were a mixed bag. There are only 5 and they varied wildly in how good they felt. The first boss was really satisfying with strong attacks broadcast well so you could learn to avoid them and counter it. The second broadcast its attacks well but I had a few issues with the hitbox being a bit off, making this harder than it could be. The third boss looked intimidating but was a fairly simplistic stage based boss. The fourth one was a mix of the first boss and basic enemies you encounter later in the game, being hard but fair. The last boss was a bit of a letdown, the first half was interesting but quickly lost tempo in the second stage.<br><br>STORIES/PLOT:<br>The game does the typical Soulslike thing of drip feeding the backstory to you. This is done through audio logs found throughout the game, messages at terminals throughout the game, NPC dialogue and finally the promotional videos found throughout the game. The audio logs piece together to build the main story slowly as well as have a few smaller stories that help to give a feeling to the human cost of the plot. The voice acting is a mixed bag, going from good to utterly terrible. The plot starts fairly bland but becomes quite interesting towards the end.<br><br>The promotional ads steal the show as they are light hearted but insightful, they require some reading between the lines to get the most out of.<br><br>LEVEL DESIGN:<br>The levels are fairly similar aesthetically, but this fits the lore of the game. The levels tend to have a single ops centre in, but this is essential as it gives the player an incentive to explore as there are plenty of shortcuts back to OPS. Given you only have a fixed amount of health top ups, this makes a longer run feel riskier knowing you could find a shortcut and level up or die and lose your progress. There are hidden areas as well as places locked off for later on in the game, meaning backtracking to get everything is required.<br><br><br>FAIRNESS:<br>Soulslike games are renowned for their difficulty and this game is no exception. The difficulty curve is....interesting. The first few areas of the game will kill you for making minor mistakes as you try to level up. You'll reach a point where you can just walk through areas effortlessly once you've learned what is ahead and how to fight them. This continues until later in the game, with the difficulty spiking, levelling out, spiking and levelling out. Towards the end of the game you will have to be pretty damn good to survive the enemies thrown at you.<br><br>Some of the enemies have issues of poorly broadcast attacks. This ranges from stuns that break combos, some one shot kills or a lot of damage over time attacks. This was my one issue. Sometimes i'd be fighting at full health and something would just tap me and kill me in one hit.<br><br>CONCLUSION:<br>Would I recommend The Surge? Yeah. I struggled initially but after a while it really gripped me.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a game by the developers of that dark souls ripoff game &quot;Lords of the Fallen&quot;.<br>You don't even have to see my negative review on that to find out so many bad things about that game.<br>The combat was horrible, slow and unresponsive. <br>Basically they tried to mimic Dark soul's lockon combat system but failed miserably as the weapons forced slow tanky playstyles.<br><br>Anyway, that being said <b>this game is 1000x better than Lords of the Fallen</b>.<br><br>I'm only one hour in and i can already see so much improvement.<br>There's a more unique combat system this time around, allowing you to target enemy's body parts.<br>You can choose to hit parts with lower or no armor to take out an enemy quick and stagger him, or you can focus on a certain limb in an attempt to dismember it and salvage it's parts.<br>Basically this involves some more thinking to the combat, but also to the salvaging/crafting.<br><br>The story and graphics are both very good and interesting. <br>Like i said i'm only 1 hour in but i'm usually very quickly bored or annoyed by the genericness of a game's plot.<br>This one's not the case so far.<br><br>Customisation is cool so far, allowing me to recover parts from enemy's limbs, or salvage broken ones to create new ones.<br>Basically you level by upgrading your &quot;power core&quot;.<br>The higher your power core; the more (powerful) equipment you can equip.<br>This forced me to pick between which armor and weapon i wanted to use before expanding on.<br><br>As for combat you can dash to dodge, jump over swings, duck under some and genuinely move from A to B to C while dodging hits very easily as long as you keep a slight sense of stamina consumption. It's very agile and fast, but so are your enemies.<br>As for attacking you can do horizontal swings and vertical swings. Both of those can be charged or chained in a combo. <br>Right now i don't see much of a difference in using the two as they both feel the same for me now, but i reckon they'll vary with later weapons in the game (i'm using one of the starting weapons).<br><br>Let's just say the game is well worth it money so far. <br>I only write reviews if i'm either very dissapointed/annoyed or when i'm genuinely impressed and latched to a game.<br>I bought this expecting to refund it especially after the sour taste Lords of the Fallen left for me, but this game is blowing me away so far.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('32273831',

I've barely had it 36 hours at this point and I have 22 hours played.<br><br>The good - The gameplay is addicting, With quite a few enemy varients as you progress and a large selection of weapons to find and use. The upgrades and armor piece are very well dispersed and actually feel useful. I'm a freakin packrat so I have pretty close to 40 or 50 as I havent gotten rid of any yet and Im still not through the whole game yet. The control scheme for controlller is completely customizable and I recomment changing the block and change target buttons around, but thats just me. The bosses I've fought against while difficult were'nt so hard that I wanted to quit playing.<br><br>The bad - There are quite a few places where you can fall to your death and given that pretty much every attack is some kind of lunge or massive sweep you will most likely fall off the edge if you try and fight near them. And while I like the control customization, when you lock onto and enemy it can be difficult to select a body part to target if they arent facing you. There is a hop and duck mechanic to avoid attacks but its not very intuetive on the controller and I find myself just dodging out of the way 99.9% of the time. And the comments about the story are very true as it has the depth and complexity of For Honor if you slept through a friends playthrough of the campeign so if you want to feel free to just jump through all the dialogue in the game, you're not missing much. There is also quite a bit that isnt told to you through the game other then the hints that show up in load screens(that only show up after you die or are moving from one area of the map to another.) and given how fast my pc loads this up i barely catch half of it.<br><br>Overall its a fun game and give it a 8/10 It would have been a 10 but its not the spiritual suscessor to Dead Space.

I enjoyed everything from the gameplay, aesthetics, to the combat and even the story.  It's very well put together and a big step in the right direction for Deck 13 Interactive (who also made Lords of the Fallen). It's one of those few games that sticks with you....or at least it did with me, and therefore I highly recommend it.<br><br>You should pick up this game if....<br> - you like Dark Souls (or souls-like) games<br> - you like a BIG challenges and learning from your mistakes and can learn to be patient!<br> - you like single player.... no multi player ;(<br> - you do not want your hand held. you learn as you go!! you don't get anything spoon fed to you except for the very basics<br> - you like dystopian futuristic settings<br> - you like cutting off limbs in brutal fashion, and using said limbs to craft gear for your awesome character<br> - you don't have hundreds of hours to play videogames (the game is relatively short, but that's a good thing in my book)<br><br>You may not like this game if.....<br> - you are all about story  (i personally like the story, but its one of those things you have to go searching for...and even then it doesn't make the most sense) It's ok, not the best.<br> - you are looking for a 'chill' game. You HAVE to pay attention in this game or you will Die....A LOT.<br> - you are looking for multiplayer or PVP.....none here<br> - you hate dark souls or souls-like games<br><br>I hope this has been helpfull.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('32211594',

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter 45 hours of gameplay and beating it twice I got to say this game is solid. All doubts I had were gone in less than 10 minutes of gameplay, though. I love the Souls games but, call me crazy, I do like to be able to actually pause the game should I choose--something this game allows you to do.<br><br>There's a Souls type of grind with the risk/reward system but at it's core this game doesn't have an extreme Souls feel. Lot brighter, for one.<br><br>My biggest issue with games like this are that the developers PURPOSELY make your character probably one of the worst fighters in games. You know what I'm talking about... slow (and I mean SLOW) swings, a stamina gauge that doesn't even help until you're 20 hours into the game, dying in one hit and insanely goofy button-mappings that certainly don't help in combat (I mean, serously, why is B always the healing button?)<br><br>But this game fixes a lot of that. Combat is very skill based from the jump and unlike other Souls-type games you won't be literally running away from the first batch of easy enemies once you figure out the mechanics.<br><br>All in all I'd recommend this game to anyone--not just fans of this genre.<br><br>My only complaint is probably the New Game + options. Most of the difficulty comes from not knowing where to go at first but by the time you push the grind and beat the game you will have been to all the locations more than once and, if you're like me, will have finished the game with a power core level of over 100. Starting a new game with all your cranked stats puts you with a severe advantage over EVERY enemy. Sure they make them harder but it took me over 30 hours to beat the game the first time whereas New Game + took me about 5 hours.<br><br>COME ON DLC!!!<br><br>Last thing: Could've used ranged weapons of some kind, too. I mean, it's the future, for God's sake. There's no one anywhere who has at least a pistol?<br><br>Game's great. Worth the price tag, also.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\"

And I was not dissapointed, for a bit. After beating the first 3 bosses you find yourself in an infinite loophole of nothing entertaining. This game is darksouls but instead of extra thicc lore its just some slop on a plate with robots instead of hollows. the bosses are all pretty much the same, the only difference is moves and looks. With Dark Souls, I found myself after beating the game to want to beat it again, and again, and again. With Surge its just kinda one of those games where you get bored, want the game to be over, finally finish it then never touch it.\t\t\t\t\t<div

Deck13 focuses more on attacking enemies, leveling up, and a faster pace while Fromsoftware focuses on a big story, exploration, and a medium pace ( except for Bloodborne). I am not saying that The Surge isn't a great place to explore but Fromsoftware has a whole grand design to their games. The Surge is its own game and while many say it is just a sci-fy souls game I think it is a game that takes succesful concepts and adds its own, with everything blending together.\t\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI just finished the game at about the 30 hour mark and am decently into a NG+.<br><br>I had a lot of fun with this game. Most of the other reviews cover all the things great about the game but I will say I really like the Sci-Fi setting and story, and the combat.I loved hunting for secrets, learning the maps and unlocking shortcuts. <br><br>If you are a fan of Dark Souls style RPGs then I would say definatly pick this up. Some of the negative reviews are pretty harsh. I would say do not listen to them. This game can be pretty rough and a little frusterating at times but I would say its still fair.<br><br>My only real negative complaint is that it is not enough content for the $50 price tag. I just want more! Also the camera and lock on system can get wierd at times. Also I dont mind grinding for gear, but this may have a little too much. I didnt like grinding for gear only to realize I didnt like the armor set more than my current set and didnt even use it.<br><br>Overall I had a ton of fun with this game. I feel like I got my money worth and would definatly pickup any DLC they offer or then next game in the series.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div

I'll edit later for more details but you can look to Mackscorner on youtube for similiar problems to mine.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('32182260', 'recent' ); return false;\">Read More</a></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"hr\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"control_block\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"text review_was_helpful\">Was this review helpful?</span>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"vote_button_ctn\" id=\"reviewButtonContainer32182260\">\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteUp( 0, 'https://store.steampowered.com/login/?redir=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2F%2Fapp%2F378540%23app_reviews_hash&redir_ssl=1&snr=1_5_100010__global-header', '32182260' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteUpBtnrecent32182260\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_upv6\"></i> Yes</span></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteDown( 0, 'https://store.steampowered.com/login/?redir=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2F%2Fapp%2F378540%23app_reviews_hash&redir_ssl=1&snr=1_5_100010__global-header', '32182260' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteDownBtnrecent32182260\"><span><i class=\"ico16 thumb_downv6\"></i> No</span></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReviewVoteTag( 0, 'https://store.steampowered.com/login/?redir=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2F%2Fapp%2F378540%23app_reviews_hash&redir_ssl=1&snr=1_5_100010__global-header', '32182260', 1, 'RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent32182260_1' )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin ico_hover \" id=\"RecommendationVoteTagBtnrecent32182260_1\"><span><i class=\"ico16 funny\"></i> Funny</span></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"UserReview_Award( 0, 'https://store.steampowered.com/login/?redir=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2F%2Fapp%2F378540%23app_reviews_hash&redir_ssl=1&snr=1_5_100010__global-header', '32182260', OnRecommendationAward )\" class=\"btnv6_grey_black btn_small_thin review_award_button\"><span><img src=\"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/public/shared/images//award_icon.svg\" class=\"reward_btn_icon\"> Award</span></a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"vote_info\" >\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3 people found this review helpful\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"review_award_ctn\" id=\"reviewAwardContainer32182260\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div style=\"clear: left;\"></div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div id=\"LoadMoreReviewsrecent\" class=\"load_more_reviews_btn\">\r\n\t\t\t<a href=\"javascript:void(0);\" onclick=\"LoadMoreReviews( 378540, 'AoJwqamXutwCdP/heg==', 0, -1, -1, 'recent' );\" class=\"btnv6_blue_blue_innerfade btn_medium\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<span>Load More Reviews</span>\r\n\t\t\t</a>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<div id=\"LoadingMoreReviewsrecent\" style=\"display: none\" class=\"loading_more_reviews\">\r\n\t\t\t<img src=\"https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/public/shared/images/throbber.gif\" class=\"loading_more_reviews_throbber\">\r\n\t\t\tLoading reviews...\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n","dayrange":0,"start_date":-1,"end_date":-1,"recommendationids":["32347635","32311873","32299565","32284870","32273831","32261727","32261332","32217939","32216741","32212203","32211594","32206308","32201840","32197350","32187935","32185604","32184759","32183962","32183646","32182260"],"cursor":"AoJwqamXutwCdP/heg=="}
