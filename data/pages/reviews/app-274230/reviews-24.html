class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTLDR: Ronin is a great game that will challenge you just enough to be truly enjoyable without being too easy. If you are a fan of laid back, brainy action over twitch gameplay this one is a must buy. <br><br>Ronin is a great idea with some really interesting mechanics. The turn based, time stalling way in which combat plays out makes timing less imprtant than strategy and helps to define the experience as a whole. The use of your various skills will also play an important role in success. <br> Moving around during any non-combat portion of the game is a combination of WASD and mouse controls. What is different from most games is that jumping is done with the mouse. Holding left click and moving the mouse will pause time and display a line that indicates the arc of your jump. You can also use a grappling hook to tether to walls, ceilings and floors mid-jump. Holding space will pause the action as well allowing you the opportunity to time certain actions like reeling in your hook.<br> During combat the jump arc will also turn red for longer jumps. This indicates that your turn will end before the jump is complete. This can be used to plan to your advantage and force enemies to aim a specific area, allowing you to perform an action at just the right time. <br> Jumping directly into an enemy can stun them and also gives you a point toward your limit break, which allows you to use learned skills. Making the best of each move can result in impressive combos that can see you clear a room in only a few moves. Not making good use of your moves, on the other hand, can quickly put you on the defensive and will have you struggling to create an opening for youyrself. <br> There are only a few different enemy types to contend with, unfoetunately. Your first encounter with the few different enemy types will require some trial and error to overcome. Once you have learned the behavior of each enemy, however, you will find that much of the challenge revolves around defeating them quickly, before they can sound an alarm.<br> Each level has a set of three bonus objectives that involve sparing civilians, killing all enemies in the level, and avoiding the triggering on an alarm. A good portion of the challenge on the first playthrough is ensuring that you complete all three bonus objectives as doing so will grant you a skill point. These point are used between levels to purchase new skills such as the ability to throw your sword or leave a decoy to confuse enemies.<br> The story is that of a woman out for revenge in a very Kill Bill sort of way. There are five individuals that she has decided simply MUST die. Every target has three levels to play through, with the objective of the third being the target themselves. While there is just enough story to keep things interesting I would have liked a little more back story on each of the targets as well as your character herself.<br> The game does have a few flaws. Jumps can be wonky at times, landing you on the same platform you started on when you were trying to jump below. Also the checkpoints can put you pretty far from a difficult section, resulting in a need to traverse large portions of the level again in order to retry. Also the game feels short. Five bosses with three levels each results in a total of 15 levels. The new game plus option adds some replay to each level by considerably changing enemy placement and tightening restrictions on bonus objectives, but I did find myself wanting more by the end.<br><br>My time with Ronin has been filled with thrilling and slick maneuvers and frustrating trial and error. On the one hand clearing a room of enemies by utilizing your many skills can lead to some really slick runs (recalling your sword and jumping over it to knock down an enemy while the sword moves past you and kills another guy is awesome). On the other hand missing the bonus objective because an enemy managed to call for help is extremely frustrating. Despite the frustrating areas, including a few I had to retry a dozen or more times, I throughly enjoyed this tale of vague revenge.\t\t\t\t\t<div

keeps the action consistent and reliable. For instance, if you're playing a shooter and you shoot an enemy in the head he's going to take damage, and if he doesn't it's because he has a shield or a helmet or something to that effect. Basically, the result of shooting said enemy is predictable, provided you don't miss. If you do miss, it's your fault - nothing to do with the game breaking the rules.<br><br>The trouble with <i>Ronin</i> is that all its rules are appended by the disclaimer &quot;except when it doesn't&quot;. For instance, in the middle of a firefight the game is frozen as it waits for you to make your move. You can jump or use a grappling hook to move around the play area and you can see red lines representing where the enemies will fire on the next turn. The rule, in this case, is that if the turn starts and you're <i>not</i> in somebody's line of fire, you won't be hit, and the game will continue. Except when this is not the case. The little arc that represents where you'll jump is sometimes completely wrong. Sometimes the little helmeted protagonist will simply not jump, instead resigning herself to death and you to a loading screen. It's a game that relies wholly on a level of precision that you are simply not given. There's no way of knowing whether your next move will spell instant death, even though the game is clearly meant to be designed so that prediction = success.<br><br>In <i>Ronin</i>, you play as a little character with a sword and a motorcycle helmet (I think it's meant to be a ninja...?) with the goal of killing a few people. We don't know why. We don't know what any of them did, nor do they (or you) have any personality. Developer Tom Wacławek was clearly into Tarantino's <i>Kill Bill</i>, since <i>Ronin</i>'s character design and rough concept are the same. Maybe this explains why the game neglects to establish our motivation (<i>Kill Bill</i> didn't fully do that until the start of the second movie), but it doesn't really excuse it. The game was already having trouble keeping me interested, the last thing it needed was a plot that essentially checked a box that said 'N/A'. It honestly feels like <i>Ronin</i> was meant to have cutscenes and my boy Tommy just forgot to put them in. Every level is either 'go and click all the computers and then get to the far right of the screen' or 'go and kill this specific person and then get to the far right of the screen'. What's the point? What did Little Miss Redhead do to <i>deserve</i> being cut up by a machete? Maybe the ending reveals all, but the gameplay inhibited the game so much that I never got there, and I can't say I feel like I missed much at all.<br><br>Said gameplay is one hell of a slog. The turn-based combat was a good concept that clearly didn't get far past the conceptual phase before being made into a game, as evidenced by the lack of genuinely challenging mechanics to spice it up. <i>Ronin</i> just stacks on more and more dudes until you're basically railroaded into jumping into the one part of the room where you won't be shot (you still might get shot). In small rooms with 2-3 enemies the mechanic was pretty cool, especially early on, when you had to juggle between one guy using a rapid-fire weapon that stays on for 2 turns, one guy sounding the alarm (who needs to be killed ASAP if you want to get the single skill point that each level gives you if you do it perfectly) and the third guy pointing his gun in the exact spot you ideally need to be in order to pass the level. A few levels in, however, the game turned into an orgy of red lines, with success hinging on the usage of an ability letting you throw your sword, which typically had to be used at the perfect time if you didn't want to fail. This is ultimately representative of <i>Ronin</i>'s biggest issue - the game expects perfection, but doesn't give you the tools to attain it. Completing the later levels was an undertaking reminiscent of trying to code a video game using only those funny keyboards that people use to subtitle live news. Come to think of it, that may be what happened here.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\"

Since civilians can trigger lockdown, the first two objectives are already at odds.

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI have never seen a game where the distance between concept and execution is as far apart as in RONIN.<br>A turnbased Hotline Miami-style game, with the same viceral feel but challenging your brain instead of your reflexes?<br>Sign me up! As much as I love the instadeath-reflex gauntlet games, I'm actually not that great at them, so this sounded perfect.<br><br>But the execution...<br>So much wasted potential, so many infuriating design mistakes, such an awful, AWFUL control scheme...<br>This game will make you rage, but not the Dark Souls-like cathartic rage of &quot;Damn, I almost had that boss&quot;, but the infuriating rage of &quot;Damn, why did you jump there, that's not what I pressed!&quot;<br>To give just a short list of those keyboard wrecking instances:<br>- The game is only turn based if the enemies initiate combat. The only way for you to initiate combat is to click on a &quot;kill&quot; button that appears below the enemy fast enough to not get shot.<br>- You can't move in turn-based mode apart from jumping. Want to climb up that ledge? Too bad.<br>- You can't control the length of your jump. Only need a short hop? Too bad.<br>- You can't directly aim where you want to jump. The jump indicator moves according to your mouse movements, but even after 2 hours of play, I have to wiggle around and guess where the game needs me to put the cursor to jump where I want.<br>- You can jump through plattforms, but not land on them then. Want to jump to a higher plane? Well, you have to go around and jump on it from the side. Or kill an enemy on it mid-jump, because that mysteriously works...<br>- Enemy shooting lines are very rough estimates at best. You can totally jump right into one and survive or not touch one and still get hit.<br>- Jump indicators as well as your sword throw indicators are rough estimates as well. You can totally hit a miniscule piece of geometry and land at a completely different place than what was indicated.<br>- If you jump next to an enemy, you will jump kick him, which might alter your jump trajectory. Or it might not. There's no way to know beforehand.<br>- Killing an enemy forces you into the same kill animation no matter where you stand. Killed an enemy while under him? If there is a bullet to his left, you're dead, because that's where the animation will place you.<br>- Enemy accuracy and reload time seems random, so killing an enemy often boils down to bunnyhopping on top of him until the other enemies miss / reload so that you can spend a turn for the kill without dying. Rinse. Repeat.<br>- The indicator if you finish a jump in one turn or need another is also just a rough estimate, you can totally make some jumps in one turn the game claims will take two, while you will randomly die because the game keeps you a millimeter from a wall it claimed your would reach.<br>- You can &quot;cancel&quot; your jump indicator, but not the &quot;jump mode&quot;, so if you bring up the jump indicator, you HAVE to jump. The game doesn't let you walk again, even if you cancel out of it.<br>- Want skill points? You'll need the optional objectives, including no alarms. Enemies will randomly grab a radio and give you a count down until you failed. Sometimes getting into their field of view makes them shoot you again. Sometimes you have to knock them down. 2 enemies at opposite ends of a large room randomly grab their radios at the same time? Congrats, you lose.<br>- Want to finish a jump started last round? There's no button for that. You actually have to take the grappling hook and then NOT grapple anything. Surrounded by things close enough to grapple? Too bad.<br><br>This is just of the top of my head.<br>I love the concept, but even most beta builds I have played have been more polished than this.<br>This isn't indie, this is a half-finished proof of concept.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('31891022',

The entire time I played it, I ALMOST had fun. I enjoyed the Kill Bill-esque story, the graphics, and the gameplay had a lot of potential. But ♥♥♥♥ me, this game is infuriating in the worst ways. It never felt like I died because of my own failure, I almost ALWAYS died due to horrible control. That grapple hook killed me more than any enemy in the game. I so wanted to enjoy this game, but the entire time I played it, I rarely actually enjoyed myself. Everytime I would plan a move, something would happen, either the hook bugs out or I end up halting at a certain point, nothing ever worked. And don't even get me ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ started on the movement. Not being able to simply climb up a ledge while in combat nearly breaks the game. It's like I have to frantically jump up and down and grapple around until I see a chance to kill someone and pray that my hook doesn't kill me, or that I don't end up hanging off a ledge, because then you're dead. I wanted to like this game, I really did. But I just can't. I didn't have fun playing this.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\"

Level design is overall above average, and it was enjoyable to play.<br>Some areas are tooth-grindingly difficult unless you cheese it with semi-OP abilities, and indications of where the hitboxes will be after moving would be nice so you know if a jump will put you under a bullet or in front of it, and the inability to move regularly (mainly climb up ledges) during combat is a bit of an annoyance.<br><br>Overall I'd prob. give it a 7/10. Worth buying while it's on sale for a bit but I dunno if I'd feel satisfied if I'd bought it for full price. Oh yeah and tricking the sword enemies into dashing out a window is great every time.<br>Also what's up with achievements not unlocking?

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tYes I reccomend the game, but only because I feel the concept is novel and should be seen. HOWEVER, the concept was mishandeled in the way of level design in some areas. There are quite a few points in the game where the map and enemy placement does not cohesively work together at all. My least favorite level by far was the Soldier's, in that level it felt like an artifical difficulty spike for a few reasons, namely that the players options are limited in unintuitive ways. The level had light posts in two points between where the Solider and the main meat of his men were placed yes, but neither are reachable with one jump, and you cannot grapple to them. There are multiple enemies with machine guys spaced out in such a way it is impossible to get rid of them before engaging the entire rest of the group. This effectively limits the players ability to move vertically, and in that level such a thing makes it frustrating because of the sheer number of enemies and shots coming your way. A simple way to completely fix all of this would to be adding a way to clean off each of the enemies with machine guns, or to lower the ceiling above the main group, or just make the light posts able to be grappled to at all. As it is, the map feels it has way too much wasted potential, I feel if the developers took more time to playtest levels to make them enjoyable moreso than difficult, issues like this would not arrise. All in all I do suggest playing it, but there are still plenty of things wrong with it that I just cannot agree with from a design standpoint.\t\t\t\t\t<div

Yes, its moving mechanics is very similiar to Gunpoint and developers even not hiding that they borrowed it from Gunpoint. Making joke of it:<br>&quot;Hint: this is not a spy game. Just kill everyone&quot;<br>I love it also for music, for stylish visuals and for &quot;easy&quot; story WITHOUT A SINGLE TEXT I HAD TO READ (hello, Gunpoints ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ storry in mails).<br>But on the other hand, i hate it. I hate it for being random. Let me explain. When in turn-based game you are doing exactly the same thing after reload, you expect that consequence will be the same, but not in this game. You need to be patient and lucky to make enemys point in the spot you need.<br>Also, very frequently it happens that line shows my traectory one way (i'm not hiting the enemy), but character does exactle the opposit (hits the enemy).<br>Manual pause sometimes works strange...<br>Thees three things are broken and made me die alot.<br>Other weak points:<br>- Very few kill animations<br>- Autotriggering of &quot;doubleaction&quot; ability<br><br>In the end of the day, i would say - buy it on sale, it might give you few intresting evenings.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div

Simply for the fact if you attempt any movement to your assumption the line will do as you want, your character will infact; do the opposite. That line gives you no TRUE direction as to what your character will do.

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI first learned about 'RONIN' off the let’s play channel 'Rage Select' for their Indie Friday videos. Based on what they showed, it seem like a really interesting game. <br><br>For the most part, I really enjoyed the game. Really dug the art design, and the music was solid. <br><br>Game Play wise, It was interesting to have a kind of Turn based-puzzle-Stealth Game, though there were some aspect of the turn based mechanic I felt like could have been handled better. Particularly the use of a Jumping arch, which had time was a bit finicky or the character wouldn't jump the way the arch displayed. I would like to see a another game in this style at some point, because I was hooked on the game play.<br><br>My biggest issue with the game though, is the paper thin story or lack of one. There is a simple story, some what like 'Kill Bill', but it's not fleshed out in any significant way. Even more so with the game having a 'Happy/Sad' ending, which didn't differ in any way that made it feel worth getting both endings, which was disappointing. There is a comic you can buy with the DLC (bundled with the Soundtrack), but it doesn’t really add much to the story then what is already in the game itself. <br><br>That aside, I would give a soft recommendation to the game “RONIN”, maybe pick it up on a Steam Sale (maybe when it’s 50% off) if you get a chance if you want to check out something interesting.<br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div
