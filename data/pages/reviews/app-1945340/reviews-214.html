montage cutscene was great and osirus's training program was one of my favourite missions to date, absoulute fire soundtrack and fast recharge strand.<br>Calus was a great fight, very challenging especially his final stand.<br><br>all the cutscenes and animations looked stunning and the visuals/soundtrack where some of my favourite in the franchise!<br><br>so far ive only done strand for my titan, and although i wasnt expecting much its actually very fun with the fast ability spam and little cooldown between attacks during super or lunge abilities. <br><br>while the pacing was a little all over the place from mission to mission and i do wish we got more of the beginning fight, most missions had very good pace and if something was urgent it made you know how urgent it was.<br><br>overall id recommend this expansion to those invested in the story/lore or wanting to experience this final year of light vs dark saga: <br>8/10\t\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI also posted this review in the Lightfall + Season pass review pool thing, and due to the seemingly more level-headed responses I'm going to remove some parts of this review that made fun of people being surprised or confused about seemingly obvious things. But still, people REALLY hate this expansion, and I'm at a loss for why. We're never going to go back to Shadowkeep. Shadowkeep doesn't have jack on this fine piece of work. Maybe the letdown for some for Lightfall was as bad as the letdown they felt with Shadowkeep, but I don't know why they could be let down considering <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>that Forsaken wasn't even that good THERE I SAID IT I SAID IT</span></span> anyway please enjoy my wall of text. My own authority on this matter is that I've been playing Destiny since 2014 and that I practice good hygiene. <br><br>I do admit, The Witch Queen had a much better campaign than Lightfall. On average, there were a lot more missions in Witch Queen that were fully fledged. A lot of the missions in Lightfall are really just Strand practice, and I'm personally ok with that. A better balance can be struck next time for learning the new subclass and doing the story mode, but this isn't the worst thing ever. (I would have to replay Beyond Light's campaign to really compare the Strand mastery, but considering I don't want to replay Beyond Light should be good enough anecdotal evidence for now). <br><br>Still, the Lightfall campaign was still rather enjoyable, more gameplay-wise and narratively. If we got it before WQ I don't think there would be any complaints, and I personally don't mind the seemingly giant plot holes the Lightfall story has. I am assuming that the Veil <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> Wasn't being explained properly on purpose, once they started Radial Masting my Radial Mast until I Radial Mast. </span></span> In fact, I was overjoyed to hear Osiris say in the Machine Gun exotic quest that <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> The Black Heart was designed as a COPY of the veil, and that they serve kind of the same purpose. Still doesn't make any sense but going into the Black Garden was fun. And the implication given to us in Beyond Light that if we didn't destroy the Black Heart we would've all been screwed is a pretty telling of the Veil's role in the future.</span></span> It was pretty apparent from the start of meeting Rohan <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> that he was going to die. He basically says &quot;I'm going to die,&quot; and then he dies, and now some of you are mad???? Sure, it would've been COOL for him to stick around a little more, but his death provided Nimbus an actual character arc beyond being quirky.</span></span> <br><br>Speaking of Nimbus, I was worried that their voice was going to be trash (and, by consequence, their character as well), because we didn't actually hear it in any promotional material, and.... frankly, I don't like their voice. I don't think it's the VA's fault (as they did some characters in Hades and were spectacular), it's just what they did to the sound in post. They seemed to have made it lower and put like 5,000 distortion effects onto it, which could've worked? I would've hated it more if Nimbus was a more unlikable character, but they have enough depth to their character that it doesn't feel like I'm talking to non-binary Shaw Han. If anything, I felt like Nimbus was more like Fynch than anyone else, both personality and game function-wise. But then the aforementioned plot-point happened, as well as the exotic quest, as well as a bunch of other little interludes and quips and anecdotes...<br><br>That is one thing that Lightfall has better than Witch Queen: The supporting cast of characters is a LOT more vast, with TONS more screen-time. Those interludes where certain characters talk to you? Eye opening. NOW I know how Caital thinks! I didn't know I needed that! Osiris slowly learning how to not be a jerk? That's pretty cool! I liked his character arc! The Neomuni? They're all dumb and I love them! They feel like people I would meet today, and I think that's the vibe they were going for. I didn't really get a part in the Witch Queen where I had characters give their opinions, probably except for Ikora. Eris Morn was there, sure, but we really didn't get good insight. Here, though, there's just a good number of goons that say what they're thinking. <br><br>I guess Bungie had more time to devote to minor characters because we were all VERY aware of Calus already. Calus! What a guy. Love him. Savathun needed some additional discovery to be done, but Calus????? We had an entire SEASON of the big boy himself! <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> and now he's dead!!!!! Remember when people got mad that major villains didn't die in raids? Whatever happened with Quria???? But yeah, Calus needed to die. Golly. And they set up Nezarec being the raid boss (maybe???) a MILLION times better than Rhulk. Nezzy actually says things in the super cool vex net strike before we kick his rear-end back to his 69th tomb. Good job for showing yourself!</span></span><br><br>Strand is also good. Sure, the grenades could use faster cool downs, but did you really want another Stasis sweep? Crucible being bad because of Strand? Imagine if people actually played crucible to care! Haha I'm just kidding, it's still good. But yeah, Strand had the tools necessary to be enjoyable and I just think people don't know how to use it to it's maximum capabilities yet. Who cares about the grenade recharge if you can get your grapple back by latching onto a tangle? You get those like, ALL the time. I'm constantly depleted of my three melees and rift and I don't want to use my grenade yet, but if I just simply finisher an enemy I can get the metaphysical ball of consciousness rolling. Maybe it sucks because you're not flowing in the river yet and YOU suck. Slugger. Or maybe Warlock is the best one and Hunter's and Titan's are bad. I did hear, however, from one of my clanmates that Titan's &quot;Green Fist of Havoc&quot; is closer to &quot;Green Spectral Blades,&quot; which sounds pretty awesome. Can't wait for people to simultaneously complain that Titan sucks and that Titan is too strong. They are the most oppressed class, after all. I also think Strand will be much more useful once people start using the other grenades, especially for endgame content. Suspending enemies is effectively freezing them, and unravel is pretty much volatile rounds. The two of those together???? Good stuff. With Quicksilver storm's catalyst getting Strand Elemental damage, I feel confident in taking it all into a GM. <br><br>But yes, despite my reasonings and excuses, there probably should've been better explanations of what was actually happening. Not because I need it, but because there must be some reasonable complaints within the visceral reactions. I guess my own admittance to the flawed system is proof enough that it could've been better. A bootlicker like me saying a game could've been better?????? No way. I also think the community is over-reacting, which given its history, makes sense. You can hate literally every single part of the game, that doesn't mean someone else can't enjoy it. Also notice how a lot of people are complaining primarily about the story. If you don't care about it, you're going to have an enjoyable time! <br><br>Regardless, I had fun, and if you've already played WQ and plan on playing more, I would still recommend it. Maybe don't lower your expectations, but set them knowing that the campy and rocky dialogue at the beginning smooths out by the end. Maybe the camp never truly goes away, but oh well.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\"

actually far improved. build-crafting is simplified, yes, but endgame content allows so much more freedom with ways to counter champions, end of match game, and the loot chase getting better all the time. while i would not recommend lightfall the campaign to newcomers, i would highly recommend lightfall the free updates and then have them go play witch queen instead. <br><br>it has been leaked that this version of lightfall was invented in the last year or so because work on the final shape needed more time. the final shape originally WAS lightfall. bearing that in mind, i personally can empathize a little with the plight of the developers. a year without an expansion both would be unsustainable for the studio, and unbearable for the player base. yes of course we as players could say &quot;well they should've just made a bunch of strikes and crucible maps and stuff&quot; and while you would be correct we are here and the content delivery model is far too established. <br><br>so far the season is good. the seasonal team will likely hit it out of the park for the rest of the year as they have continued to do over the last two years. here's to hoping they nail it with final shape.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('133907620',

it up best: &quot;Wait, that's it? That was the end?&quot;. <br><br>To keep it short, it's not bad, definitely not as bad as some people are making it out to be, but it's definitely underwhelming and a step back from Witch Queen. The campaign alone is not worth $50 so if that's all you want to do, I would not recommend it. Otherwise kind of in a &quot;wait and see&quot; position for the rest of the game. I think an incredible raid could really bring home the story, but it has a lot of work cut out for it. <br><br>The whole campaign I felt like I was a beta tester 3 quarters before the DLC was set to launch.

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSo I'm going to immediately just say that I would rate this expansion lower than Beyond Light, but better than Shadowkeep. Overall, this is a very mediocre expansion that's hollow inside. I'll try to avoid spoilers in this review, but the storyline is so hollow that the review itself is basically a spoiler. TL;DR: I don't reccomend this until we know if the raid is good. If you don't raid and aren't a hardcore player, I would just skip this expansion and just buy the season pass instead.<br><br><b>The story:</b> <br><br>This is easily the worst part of the expansion. In terms of coherence... there is none. I'm not exaggerating here. The storyline is less coherent than Curse of Osiris. The campaign is basically just a chase the macguffin plot where you need to go find this thing that is very important and everyone tells you it's important. The problem is that no one tells you what it is or why it's important. I completed the entire campaign and I still don't know what it is or why it's there. Other than one line at the end of the previous season, there is absolutely zero in game context for what is going on in this plotline. <br><br>Familiar characters return to help in the present battle, while you meet the Cloudstriders as well. Now personally, I did not dislike these new characters as much as others did, however, there is very little interaction you have with them in the story. They're with you over the comms and sometimes in the playspace like you might expect, but you're basically introduced to them and immediately expected to treat them like your old buddies even though you just met them.<br><br>The sideplots of the story are better than the main arc, but they still leave a lot to be desired. I don't want to spoil anything, but the decisions bungie made with the side characters make them feel like they aren't real, even though they have quite good dialogue and they are fun to listen to when you finish the campaign.<br><br>Some smaller nitpicks that I have are that Osiris automatically knows what Strand is called without any explanation. Not even a &quot;I just decided to call it Strand, guardian.&quot; Our ghosts also somehow know what Tormentors are called when we see them, even though there is no reason for this. <br><br><br><b>Strand:</b> <br><br>I decided to make this it's own section because even though it's a gameplay element, it's heavily relevant to the story (and not in a good way). At least a third of the main storyline are about learning to use strand. I don't mean like Beyond Light where you just use Stasis at the end of each boss encounter. Strand is used as a narrative device, and it's not a very good one. It feels like it was forced into the story in a very rough manner, with some unnecessary and far fetched strand related plot points. There are literally devices the Cabal deploy just so you're forced to use Strand to destroy them. <br><br>From a gameplay perspective, strand isn't too bad. You get very fast cooldowns for your grapple during the campaign and fast cooldowns for your other abilities for about half of the missions. I only played warlock, but the abilities were somewhat interesting, although they were quite underpowered, even with the higher than normal ability uptime. The grind to unlock the Strand fragments are character specific and it is somewhat tedious, although less so than the Stasis grind. Overall, I expect Strand to have major buffs in the future. I doubt it will be used much even with all the fragments unlocked, and absolutely not in high end content like master raids and GM nightfalls. <br><br><br><b>Gameplay:</b> <br><br>The gameplay this expansion is fine and just like Destiny, so if you like Destiny, you'll like the gameplay. I will say though that the mod updates makes things more streamlined, however, if you like in depth build crafting, well... the depth is gone. <br><br>Mission structure is solid overall and allows you to have fun with whatever you want to use. I did the campaign on Legendary solo and I was able to use a variety of weapons and abilities. Don't expect it to be easy mode though, so if you like a challenge, you'll be right at home. I don't think there's too much to say about gameplay given that it's tied to the game's core systems. The enemy density in the missions are actually fantastic, so you do feel powerful and like you're on the front lines of a war. The missions have very rudimentary mechanics, but that's to be expected with a campaign.<br><br><br><b>SPOILERS:</b><br><br><span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> Ok, so time for my unfiltered opinions on the expansion overall. The beginning and ending cutscenes line up perfectly such that it's quite apparent they were initally just one single cutscene that was chopped in half so Bungie could throw in a filler storyline about the Veil. This makes sense given that they announced back in Season 15 that Lightfall was no longer the ending of the saga and that the Final Shape would be the end to the story of light and dark. This would also explain the lack of explanation about the Veil and Radial Mast and what all of this means in the grand scheme of things. I don't think Bungie had intended to even have these things in the initial storyline for Lightfall. Furthermore, all of the (non-raid, we don't have that yet) weapons for Lightfall and Season of Defiance are reskinned from previous expansions or seasons. Not a single weapons that we've seen so far is a new model. Even Neomuna is just a bunch of Braytech assets from Beyond LIght that are reused to make up the buildings. Overall, this seems to be a giant cashgrab that was hastily made to make up for the lack of dev time they had to finish the original ending (what's now the Final Shape). </span></span><br><br>Would I recommend this to anyone who isn't a diehard Destiny fan who plays endgame content? No, absolutely not. Given that Season of Defiance already has a better storyline than the entirety of the Lightfall campaign shows how little Bungie cared to make this experience memorable. If you want to just shoot things and use space magic, you can do that in any of the seasonal content, as Lightfall doesn't have much more depth than a normal season. <br>\t\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tLet's keep it simple,<br><br>Pros:<br><br>-Neomuna Destination, very pretty and neat to explore<br>-Campaign Cut-scenes, the one thing that Bungie never fails at<br>-Game Overhaul, thankfully lots of QoL changes that were much needed, and a simpler mod overhaul<br>-The new Raid. It is short and sweet, and very fun. But that can't go without saying that its a little too easy... and it shouldn't have taken 2 hours to get a worlds first on a expansion raid.<br><br>Cons:<br><br>-Nimbus, cannot stand any of his dialogue. As it can feel very out of place with how poorly written and extremely cringe the dialogue is, with also trying take it seriously at the same time. Worse than Shaw Han<br>-Campaign, very, very disappointed with it (Worse than Shadowkeep imo)<br>-Strand, very cool supers but are pretty weak in most cases.<br><br>It hurts me to write this review as a longtime veteran of Destiny since 2014 as I love the franchise so dearly, but this is just not worth it.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDestiny 2: Lightfall was suppose to be the end of everything. But only end I saw was the story just sucking actually D1 Y1 level of writing.<br><br>I been playing this Game from Shadowkeep in 2019 and i got to say the level of writing i saw in this story has been the worse writing I have seen from the series for a LONG TIME. Even the seasonal story line seem to be BETTER then the actually DLC.<br><br>To me this DLC feel like filler content and it actually hurt me to say that but it really does feel like filler to pad out the Light and Darkness Saga. This got kinda of confirmed on D2Leaks. <br>Nothing is explain, the story has does not explain ♥♥♥♥. If you told me what the ending for the DLC is as a new player asking a Vet. I would not be able to tell you because Bungie, the same devs that made Halo. Were unable to explain to me, the player this VERY KEY STORY LINK. <br><br>The story has so many holes, and the subclass outside itself of the story just feel super super weak. <br>This DLC was suppose to be a 10 year plan since Destiny 1 and the fact it fall down on it face like this without time to cook it is just sad. It just feel really rushed.<br>The feedback and the review nuking that people are giving is not because Destiny is a bad game, it is just the story for a DLC sucks. My only hope is that Bungie is able to fix this story before the Final Shape because of they are unable to do it. I dont know what to say the final shape will just suck.<br><br>The main question is should i buy this. Simple answer no, i cant recommend this game to new or returning players at all. I would recommend going back to Witch Queen and playing the story because that story is really good.<br><br>If you want hardcore review on this DLC go check out mynameisbyf Destiny 2 first impression and that will pretty much sum up all my problem i have with this DLC.<br>I will come back and update this review after the Day 1 Raid but if nothing changes i guess this review will stay the same.<br><br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\"

It didn't expand on anything and just left me with more questions then it answered. I had more hope for the story but it just didn't deliver. I don't think it was bad or good it was just. ok. <br>Witch queens year was so good story wise yet lightfall failed on the story I feel. <br><br>The gameplay on the other hand was great. It was so much fun. I loved the legend campaign and the post game just the most important thing was fumbled.<br><br>3/8/2023 edit:<br>I still think the story was pretty bad and it's not a good look for people just getting into the series but they have nailed the gameplay and if you are someone who likes strong gameplay It's really not a bad place to start. They have introduced so many good quality of life changes in the past few seasons and it's only gonna get better. While narratively the expansion sucked it has done everything else great.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div

Campaign was great gameplay wise, lots of strand sources to use. The new characters are really something fresh, especially Nimbus, I just love the 80's action movie vibe they went with.

greatest moment straight up breaks my heart. A lot of the criticism I would like to give would simply be too spoilery to put here, but in summary it feels like they diced up the content and left us with a weird and unfulling mess of a campaign. Saying we actually fight the witness is a huge stretch and what we actually do makes no sense and accomplishes nothing. Post campaign content is looking solid and the raid has yet to release, but if you're as a new player or if you're here for the campaign/story I simply cannot recommend this overhyped and overpriced dissapointment of an expansion to you.<br><br>Edit: Raid's out and it sucks, prolly just gonna step away until Final Shape drops\t\t\t\t\t<div
