I don't hate this game though, it is a first game after all, and if this was the dev's first game ever, then i'm impressed with doing a long game like this.<br><br>SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Firstly, the story is relatively good, the mystery aspect is pretty well done, and there were some good plot twists. I accidentally saw a review say that they thought that Simon wasn't that good, and i was worried i was going to deal with an insufferable protagonist, thankfully, he wasn't, but i wouldn't say he's perfect. I think with the routes, there ends up coming a problem with his character, sometimes he makes decisions that are absolutely bone headed, such as trying to kill himself to save fake Hannah, and when fake Hannah does sacrifice herself, when Simon sees that there are &quot;clones&quot; of everyone else, he doesn't think anything through, and just runs through the door, getting himself killed.<br><br>yet, in by far the best written timeline, when Simon outplays everyone else, his paranoia gets the better of him, but he is able to use it as a strength, as he uses the old gun to fool agnos, and later find out he needs to leave with e. <br><br>I think the issue with the loops is that Simon can either be a good character, or bad character based on how choices pan out, but without something to keep him still &quot;likable enough&quot;, it makes me kinda not happy with him at points. on that note<br><br>CHARACTERS ARE KINDA WEIRD<br><br>Agnos is by far the highlight, he was a very compelling enemy, and after the first route, i was always trying to make sure to act before he acts. this helps when sometimes OTHER characters go crazy. He is very static, but i think in a good way.<br><br>Fake hannah, i feel bad for her, because she isn't really able to expand as a charterer, as is more of an extension of real Hannah. I think there could've been an interesting arc for her, but she is shafted to be killed in the reactor, and then just help out Simon (briefly) when real Hannah and Greta meet up<br><br>Greta, again, underutilized, but i think its not as bad. She did have some good interactions with Simon, and she is the most &quot;complex&quot; character, though its not by much.<br><br>marco, disappointing, to say the least, he barely has a stake in the story, and he is seemingly both working, and against the empty S. This could've provided an interesting prospective, if, lets say he partners up with agnos, but then it comes out more was going on, or idk, something else, at most he just has a mental breakdown near the end<br><br>Ray, funnily enough, the one character that said his name is the one we know the least about. He is a good secondary antag, and he did cause some damage. his collapse at the end was sad, but fitting for him. I feel there coulda been more, especially since he did help Simon get the gun, and other information. hell, i was expecting him to be revealed to be Zachary, but guess not. seems kinda wasted, and he got better treatment<br><br>jasmine (REAL Hannah) Pretty good, she had some good moments, both crazy and rational, but her personality kinda doesn't separate herself well from the others. which is a shame, because 1. jasmine could be a good character, 2. Hannah post birth ME code would be interesting to explore. <br><br>e/Emily is kinda odd, for one thing, she is both a damsel in distress, but the mastermind. in the first route, i would be hesitant to call her the MM, more of an unwilling accomplice. excluding birth me code, she is easily the most intreging charterer. but emily herself has E (as in the one from the original route) act on her own, and kinda isn't allowed to grow. Emily as the MM (specifically the woman we meet at the end) is very interesting, her motives are kinda yandere-ish, yet you could argue it was for a good reason, although at the same time, if she could revive Simon, why didn't she help save the others? And throwing in birth ME code, it gets more complicated. <br><br>Another issue is that some stuff isn't fully explained until birth me code, which yeah, its intended to be a trilogy, but i feel like with some of the stuff, it isn't explained *enough* for the player to understand it, but keep it hidden. maybe more could be added, such as with Marco's conflicting loyalties, and more about agnos's personal life, and so on and so forth.<br><br>THE DEATH GAME ITSELF<br><br>these people should have no excuse to be so dumb, The answer was so obvious, but they made themselves look like idiots, i guessed as soon as i saw the numbers that the real answer was just to pair up with people to get 9, and not a 9th man, meaning there was no traitor. Yet they went on a wild goose chase that isn't something that can be blamed on smiley. Even with the only 2 survivors rule, like, Come on...!<br><br>Another problem is with the format of the death game, which has no real time limit, it leads to a problem of pacing, it leads to the first route being WAY too long because the writer is way to UN-restricted in the amount of time it takes to reach an end. The flow chart making you jump to different points, while nice for quality of life things, makes it insanely quick in contrast.<br><br>PUZZLES<br><br>Non existent, i refuse to call the searches game play. I'm not okay with that, at least have some challenge, it doesn't even need to be justified like with 999, i don't like the fact the only puzzles were the church and the pool. the latter of which can be brute forced.<br><br>GRAMMAR ISSUES<br><br>I'll admit, i kinda suck at detecting grammar issues, but there was stuff i did see, like words that should be swapped, some stuff that wasn't clear. the game diffidently would need a proofreader, or at least a 2nd read through.<br><br>ENDING<br><br>Well played, its very interesting to have plot points like the reveal that the game was rigged so Simon and Emily WOULD ONLY live. Causing retroactive despair, as you realize the twins didn't actually get out as you thought. Simon's final choice was a really well done moment, as i spend a solid 5 minutes thinking about it, and to take away player choice HERE was a good moment for Simon's &quot;arc&quot; so to speck. His suicide though is very interesting, he did at least protect the 17 pair, but you could also argue he could've just tossed the dead Emily's body onto the contraption, then give the new E the 19 collar. But i think the point behind the suicide, a final ♥♥♥♥ you to &quot;god&quot; by Simon, even if its very irrational is a good way to cap off the game.<br><br>overall, while i still liked the game, its no where near as good as birth me code. I'm sure the devs will hone their skill, i mean, they did a route based death game, that's not only one of my favorite types of games, but its also a lot of work. Hope you guys do well further in life!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\"

The introduction definitely could use a bit more action or interesting dialogue but I do recommend you power through it as this game starts to get insane once you finish the first ending. It's a slow burn, even after the prologue so do note you're not going to be zooming through the story. Still, while the prologue may at first feel strangely placed, it is not at all unintentional.<br><br>The only issues I had with this game is the writing in some regards. Sometimes this game will just suddenly gut-punch you with Simon making a joke that is just cringe and not at all charming, way too many references to other media at one time in an active search, or characters engaging too long in a joke that did not at all land. <br><br>The characters are honestly fine, not exceptional, but are tolerable. The only characters I felt were great were Ray (honestly shocked me), A, and E. The rest are fine but I feel they're a bit underdeveloped and not very unique characters, as they more rely on the plot developments to characterize them. They lack more obvious distinctions in their personality traits and aren't as memorable as the characters I listed before. They still do get interesting backstories and while that didn't make me that much more inclined to them, it was definitely better than nothing. <br><br>The story starts off slow but then becomes this timeline jumping exciting experience of trying to piece things together to solve the missing parts of other timelines. It's pretty much a puzzle and since everyone is CONSTANTLY LEAVING INSTEAD OF STICKING TOGETHER, as you progress the story, you'll have moments in which you suddenly realize who could have been where, who could have done what, the true meaning behind the events of the game, whats really happening in the station. You're constantly having theories checked, denied, or accepted and then moving to the next bit to further figure things out and I loved it! It gives the game this constant intrigue and excites you to play more and more to figure out what happened and what's going on. The story for me was the best thing HAS had to offer.<br><br>Finally, the sprite art-style is a bit odd but I got used to it pretty fast, although as much as this might be rude I really think the CG style should have been used for sprites instead. I'm unsure if it's the same artist, but characters like Ray have terrible sprite art and the CGs make this problem even more apparent as you're seeing a more desirable version of these characters that the sprite work is not at all delivering on. Most of them are close enough but Ray's is just so distracting after you get to that one CG. The CG art was phenomenal and I honestly wish there were more CGs as I find that style to be very satisfying.<br><br>Overall, starts off slow but picks up rapidly and becomes a very fun and entertaining mystery VN where you're just constantly wondering &quot;What the ♥♥♥♥ is happening&quot;<br><br><br>\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tTL;DR - This game is a very ambitious first release that feels like an homage to Zero Escape in all of the right ways. It has a lot of problems with it, but if you're someone who has played Zero Escape that is yearning for that feeling you got when each of the games' plots unraveled around you and you saw what was going on in 4k for the first time, definitely play this game. It captures that feeling for sure. If you haven't played Zero Escape, well, play those games first. <br><br>------<br><br>This game wears its Zero Escape influences on it's sleeve. Its concept and plot are very reminiscent of the Zero Escape series, and will definitely resonate with ZE players in a similar fashion.  Let's break down specifics.<br><br>------<br><br>Pros:<br>- The scenario, once all the cards are on the table, is very cool and its twists and meta moments definitely live up to the Zero Escape name.<br><br>- The CGs and backgrounds look fantastic.<br><br>- The music is quite good. Nothing incredible here, but you could have played me any of the songs from this game before I'd played it through, and reasonably convinced me they were from a Zero Escape game. However, that sometimes is a bit on the nose. One song in particular sounds very much like a mixture of Blue Bird Lamentation and Morphogenetic Sorrow, in a way that doesn't leave a good taste in my mouth.<br><br>Huh. Now that I'm writing it out, there are less of those than I had first thought. Anyway, moving on to the negatives.<br><br>------<br><br>Cons:<br>- The sprites are strange looking at best, and downright ugly at worst. The character designs themselves are alright -- I quite liked E's design -- but every character has one sprite where they look very inhuman and/or bizarre, and with several characters, namely Ray and Jasmine, this is true for *most* of their sprites. Marco's design I dislike, but in a way that I'm not sure how to put into words.<br><br>- The are exactly 2 real puzzles in the game. &quot;What? But it's a game centered around escape rooms!&quot; you might say. Yes, it is. However, with only two exceptions, every single puzzle (when there even are puzzles, most of the escape rooms are incredibly linear, and some are as simple as clicking a door for times in a row) is solved by the protagonist, Simon, through narration. This wouldn't be as bad if there weren't really escape rooms, but the fact that the game centers around escape rooms yet the player is completely shielded from all of the puzzles except 2 absolutely *astounds* me. There were several instances where I read the setup for a puzzle, got excited thinking I knew what the answer was and was gearing up to give it a shot, when Simon completely stole the show through the narration. Similarly, any codes come across, like a rot13 cipher in one of the escape rooms, are solved for the player. Except, bizarrely, an obvious anagram that winds up being plot relevant, which was made exceedingly obvious by the fact that it was called out as an obvious anagram yet Simon, this one time, inexplicably says &quot;oh, well!&quot; and continues on about his day. It feels very random to me which rooms even have puzzles, which have puzzles the player can solve, and which have puzzles that Simon narrates through (in fact, one of the puzzles that you actually do get to solve gets narrated through on another route lmao).<br><br>- The dialogue is hit or miss. It's fine most of the time, but some lines are *really, really* bad. Almost all of the jokes fall very flat, which means that Marco, whose dialogue is 90% jokes, gets his screen time turned mostly into &quot;god please stop making sex jokes and get back to the puzzle&quot;. Honestly, a lot of the problems I ran into here really could be explained by English not being the author's first language, and if that's the case, I totally get it, and replace my criticism of the dialogue with a friendly suggestion to have a few rounds of proofreading with native English speakers.<br><br>- Building on that last point, most of the characters are more plot devices than actual characters. The only character I actually cared about by the end of the game was E -- most of the others were jerks, hard to listen to due to dialogue, or completely 1-dimensional.<br><br>- A very large portion of the game feels like it could have been cut. A hallmark of the Zero Escape series is that each of the endings you had to reach before the true ending gave you more information that you could use to piece together the plot or that tantalized you on the twists coming. This game...doesn't do that. It has 19 endings, only 7 of which are required to unlock the true ending, for a total of 8 routes that actually matter. In fact, there's even an achievement for seeing the True Ending with the minimal number of routes complete. The fact that this achievement exists at all should raise an eyebrow. The other 11 routes add next to nothing to the story. Most of them are just as long as the endings that actually matter, dragging on for sometimes entire escape rooms (Yes, there are entire escape rooms that are missable!) only to be given no helpful information and sometimes not even a cliffhanger. In several of these bad endings, Simon is killed with no fanfare and learns absolutely nothing about the identity of his killer, which was interesting once, but when it happens 4 or 5 times, it crosses from boring into downright frustrating. Several of these extra 11 routes, if not all of them, could have been completely cut from the game, subbed in for a quick game over screen, and nothing of value would have been lost. Now, don't get me wrong, some of them had fun dialogue, and a much better solution would just be to shuffle things around so that even if they aren't required, they provide more to the story than just some extra dialogue, or a shallow character moment.<br><br>- Even though the scenario is super cool, there are quite a few questions left unanswered. Perhaps these will be answered in the second game, which I have yet to play, but as it stands, there are quite a few questions I have about the plot that the game seemingly has not answered. And yes, I have 100%'d the game and seen every dialogue option.<br><br>------<br><br>Now, if you've just read all of that, you must be wondering how I could possibly be recommending this game. I could have been much more critical. This game frustrated me at times. However, *it was worth it*. The twists were surprisingly really, really good, and there are several moments where things that have been staring you in the face the entire time jump out at you and give you that jaw dropping feeling.<br><br>I'm posting this review not being I disliked this game, but *because* I liked it. This author/developer is obviously very talented, the scenario they wrote is actually quite good, and I wish to see more of what they can do. I've tried to stick to constructive criticism and tried to both provide prospective players with a detailed look at what they're getting into, but also something that the developer could hopefully read and see a fan's opinions on what worked and what didn't.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAn inferior Zero Escape, but one that retains all of that franchise's problems.<br><br>The writing is… not good. Everyone takes five times as long as they need to make their points, and the protagonist is the least likable character in the game, regularly engaging in some truly juvenile humour and utterly baffling thought processes. It also has the same problem Zero Hour had of characters just out of nowhere vomiting information about some obscure thing that the author wants you to know about so that their awful pseudoscience ending can come about.<br><br>I didn’t care about a single person in this game by the end, because they’re never really developed as people, just means to arbitrary endings and info dumps.<br><br>Right at the start the characters so wildly, and obviously, misinterpret the rules that they’re given that I assumed this was going to lead to some grand twist. It never does. The entire game within the game is so close to irrelevance, disconnected as it is from the plot, that it could have been literally anything.<br><br>The puzzle rooms feel like something that ending up being cut for time or money, absent as they are puzzles. There are only about two real puzzles in the entire game, with the protagonist narrating both the puzzle and solution in every other room, leading to you doing nothing but engaging in some time wasting clicking on icons.<br><br>There’s really nothing to recommend about this game unless you’re just that desperate for a poor man's Zero Escape experience.\t\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWants to be a Notary Game so bad, but isn't. Not the worst crime, since 999 is a masterpiece and even a poor imitation is still a decent game. Enjoyable navigation with the ability to skip unseen text, some genuinely surprising endings and a thoroughly used and enjoyed feature that shows which items and dialogue have already been viewed for optimal replay and 100% completion value). Also, the game has an in universe justification for its meta structure as well as some fourth wall breakings that worked pretty well for me.<br><br>However! - most if not all of the major characters go underdeveloped. Despite routinely giving you choices of who to explore rooms and make small talk with, I very rarely felt I understood a character's motivations. Characters are established as shady or trustworthy or ♥♥♥♥♥♥ or down to earth, but there were maybe 3 characters who wouldn't act the same as every other character in any situation (and one of those is a girl who is blind and deaf, so). Even your character's established best friends are flat, they both have at least one timeline where they turn on you/make some allegedly wildly out of character choice, and it completely fumbled for me just because I barely understood what acting IN character would look like for them. Plus, the game definitely suffers from ending fatigue - while it at least makes narrative sense that <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> there's no massive fight with the major villain of the game </span></span>, it doesn't make the <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span> villain sits and exposition dumps the entire plot to you </span></span> trope less overdone mindnumbingly boring.<br><br>Good outweighs the bad though in my opinion. The mystery sustains with some truly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ insane endings towards the end that really ramp up your desire to find the truth (even if that isn't exactly rewarded; see above). Beat the entire thing completely, including 100% completion of all rooms and areas, in about 6 hours, so if it's a rainy day and you enjoyed 999, pick it up.\t\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tI don't usually write reviews (even though i should but i'm often lazy) but i needed to do one for this gem of a game. As other reviews have said it , if you like zero escape/danganronpa/AI somnium files, its a MUST buy, the inspiration (especially ZE) is all over the place and you will feel right at home .<br><br>The artstyle was weird for me at first, but it quickly grew on me, characters are interesting and likable ( E basically feels useless though , you will know why when you play the game lol) speaking of, i didn't really like the whole initials nickname thing, especially because it really didn't do a whole lot in the game, i would have rather liked unique nicknames in general. <br><br>The music was very much on point. It hits that ZE feels again, and i've had times where i was feeling uneased and a bit stressful because of it (which is a great thing! ) <br><br>The writing was questionable at times, some sentences/characters thoughts didn't really make sense sometimes, but overall it was really good, with a lot of puns and good dialogue ; I really liked that it took inspiration from AI and made all chapters a wordplay with &quot;AS&quot; , very clever ! <br><br>Puzzles were fine , there's barely any per-say because its mostly automatic, but it was cool to see characters help each other to escape (though again, you spend a lot of time with E that does almost nothing most of the time , i would have liked more character interactions during escapes) <br><br>I don't know why, but i LOVE flowcharts in VN, and this one is the most enjoyable i've seen in a game with all the colors, choices and stuff , it's simple but really cool-looking, and the final view of it makes it really nice.<br><br>Like i said, this game is a no-brainer if you like ZE , or similar type of games, the price is right (i feel like it could have been even more honestly) the story is very engaging, with a true end thats really gonna make you go &quot;aah so thats why&quot; for many of your questions during the game, i was honestly very surprised by how well thought out everything was , there IS still a few discrepancies, and some things kinda made me feel &quot;thats a bit TOO convenient it works that way&quot;<br> <br>Overall i really don't have much to complain about , please buy this game and the sequel (at the time of this review i haven't played it yet but i heard its much better!) to encourage the developer , he's also making a third game, and you should really help motivate him by buying his other games!\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\"

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSo, Head AS Code, the prequel to BMEC(which can also operate as a sequel if you played BMEC first). I went into this having played BMEC(Birth ME Code) first, and that game was honestly a...lot better? But, that doesn't detract from this game being good, and especially not how it stood to play after BMEC. I don't want to get too spoily, but if you like BMEC, and you genuinely enjoyed it, picking this up isn't a bad idea. However, if you did NOT like BMEC for any reason, really, I wouldn't recommend playing this game. You can play them in any order, but knowing what you know when finishing this, I think things being detracted from BMEC would worsen the experience, while detracting from this game, doesn't do much. It's a good solid visual novel, which isn't shaken much by BMEC.<br><br>However, playing this before BMEC and knowing the things you know in this game could detract from...a lot. As I said above, if you've played BMEC and liked it, I strongly recommend this. Otherwise, don't start with this. I mean, to be fair, it's not the experience I had, but I can't see the other way being that...enjoyable? Not because it would spoil a lot, but because the questions you would have at this would leave you &quot;meh'd&quot; at the answers, while playing this after would keep you confused for quite a bit, but not necessarily detract from it.<br><br>Now, what does it bring? Not as much in escape rooms/puzzles as BMEC(although I think the original/non-art updated version does have that?), but it's pretty, has some nice tunes, has a gripping story tbh(much like it's sister-game bmec, technically it is the sequel though but...I strongly do recommend playing that game first as it is the stronger game,both in puzzles and characters, even if this has a better story). So I'm going to give it a positive, as it is a good game. But, don't do it without having played BMEC? Especially since you can play them in any order. If this is a bit messy, I did come back and finish the game after my old computer broke. I'm sure there's secrets left to uncover that I haven't nitpicked out yet like I did BMEC.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t[This review is spoiler free]<br><br>Much like probably many who come across this title will be in the quest of a death game experience with multiple endings, in the style one Zero Escape. This is the main reason why I have gotten interested in the Abime Series, Head AS Code being the first of an on-going trilogy at the time of writing this review.<br><br>I will start by saying that whilst both Abime and Zero Escape as series share similarities and one references the other (alongside putting references for other games of the genre at various points along the game!), they are pretty much different. They are both from the same genre, but they aren't the same experience but trust me that's not a bad thing!<br><br><u>If you play the demo:</u><br>The demo only offers and overview of the game mechanics and the beginning of a mystery idea, however, it might not leave a very strong first impression. I would tend to say that the demo doesn't leave a lot of elements as to what the game truly is about, so I'd still recommend that you give it a try even if the demo wasn't quite what you expected it to be. I did it and I didn't regret in the end!<br><br><u>My experience:</u><br>I didn't quite know what to expect of the game (different cast/theory/death game rules/production and size) so initially being, as mentioned before, a Zero Escape player, I immediately tried spotting the differences, and obviously there were a few at first which were very refreshing. <br>The puzzle rooms aren't quite as complex as one might expect, they involve just a bit of clicking and less solving (and also a lot of puns, and I love puns so that's alright), the game being very much story-driven. There's I believe about 3 rooms that require a lot more thought. <br>This goes on for a while without being particularly boring, the story is well written and entertaining with some mystery, a bit of science fiction and action. <br>The endings (19 of them) are pretty rapidly reached and it is easy to understand what one must do to reach other endings until the True Ending. However, as you progress more and more and get more endings, the game takes a very taking twist. I'm not going to elaborate more, I'm just going to say that if you, like me, came to this game with only an experience of Chunsoft Games, you'll never be ready for the plot twists and turns that the game takes. Some of the more surprising elements appear as you come closer to the True Ending so stick around!<br>I didn't feel empty after reaching the final ending, and was very much happy to be moving to its sequel next.<br><br><u>Would I recommend it?</u><br>I'd say yes. For some, 16 EUR might be a bit much but I think it's quite alright for the experience it offers. It's even better if bought as a bundle with Birth ME Code. If you truly want you can wait for a sale, but I'd say that the developer (independent) put a lot of effort into it and is struggling to make this game succeed so I'd say if you can, help them as best as you can by spreading the word and playing it. :D\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\"

more emphasis on suspense and atmosphere. There's puzzles along the way, but most of them are solved for you, and while the ones that aren't may be confusing at first, they boil down to the order you interact with things. Additionally, the flowchart is really easy to look at and use, so don't be afraid of the fact that there's multiple endings.\t\t\t\t\t<div

class=\"content\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThe ending to this made way more sense than Birth: ME Code did.<br><br>I do think the more I play these sorts of things that the surprise random science / pseudoscience lesson gets a bit much, but I can't say that they weren't relevant. <br><br>I can't speak too harshly though.  I knew exactly what I signed up for and got what I wanted.<br>A few critiques though, and I'm hoping that Miracle Moon manages to improve on as a studio moving forward:<br><br>The art style works but I still think it's a bit rougher than I'd like it to be. It's not that the characters are unexpressive or unmemorable, it's not the backgrounds or even the directorial vision. I think it's more the art style itself.  I think someone is either an artist second, or MM has exactly one person who makes the drawings and after they come in with their first pitch, whoever programs the game says &quot;Perfect!&quot; and throws it in as is before asking for the next one.<br><br>An ambitious and expensive goal: Voice Acting and music. This game has none of it (the sound track struck me as generally on point, but I can't pick out a memorable song). The game could be better with improvements to these as well.<br><br>One genuine negative I do want to note is that there aren't a lot of actual *puzzles* this time around. I wound up taking a lot more notes than I ended up using because most of the time Simon encounters a puzzle, he just narrates solving it. A lot of rooms can be finished by interacting with ever object until none are left.  There is a reason for this I discovered, but while it makes sense narratively, it is a bit unfulfilling at times.<br><br>Really though, I think that's more evidence that Miracle Moon knows exactly what they're doing with these games, they're just held back by budget and staff size. I'm hoping they find that success because I'm being unfairly nitpicky.<br><br>Update: After a little bit of review, I got a reminder that Head AS Code is actually the <i>first</i> game, so the comparisons to its sequel (which was released on Steam before Head as Code) are somewhat unfair of me.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div

The plot is about as convoluted as one of those games, but still fun, and the characters are decently developed. I did feel as though some of them <span class=\"bb_spoiler\"><span>(especially Marco)</span></span> could have used something deeper than their surface level personality. <br>The music was solid throughout, although I would have liked some of the softer songs to play longer at the end of paths. I think the weakest part overall was the writing, which was definitely not as strong as 999. This isn't surprising considering this appears to be a one man project, but just something to keep in mind.<br>Having puzzles be extremely sparse, and the VN more like a KN at times was an interesting choice, and it really depends on if you prefer that to the sometimes irritatingly long puzzles of Zero Escape games.<br>Overall, I recommend the game, especially if you're a fan of Zero Escape.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"posted\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"view_more\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"UserReviewShowMore('99309520',

The characters are well written and are a lot deeper than they first seem on the surface. The plot's branching paths had me gasping in genuine shock on more than one occasion. All the twists and turns this plot has can definitely be described as an emotional rollercoaster.<br><br>It's clear this game was inspired by the Zero Escape series, however don't let that fool you into thinking it's just a bad version of it. Head AS Code can stand as a great game on it's own and even exceeds Zero Escape in some areas.\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"gradient\"></div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<div

If you like Zero Escape, this game can spark the interest. The character cast is solid, and all of them can get memorable.<br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Mechanics</div>Unlike HASC's sister game, Birth ME Code, this one provides a calmer experience, focusing more on the story. Some may find it detrimental, but I think it makes the game much less strenuous, without hindering the story with moments one can get stuck on. There is one (or three) puzzle(z), but it doesn't make the game that difficult.<br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Graphics</div>This may highlight my flaw of focusing more on form than content, but the UI design is pretty solid.<br><hr></hr><br><div class=\"bb_h1\">Verdict</div>This game, although very niche, serves as a very nice entry point ot the ABiMe series.
